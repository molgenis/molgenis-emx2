## Todo and open issues

Idea:

* move all columns except primary key from subclass table to rootclass table
* then 
  * queries are much simpler and faster (no silly joining needed)
  * metadata of a table subclass tree is easily managed
  * columns can be easily added/removed from/to subclasses
  * still, foreign key constraints can be checked against a subclass table

### Done

* composite foreign key
* fix if drop schema also removes all roles for this schema
* show only schemas in navigator if anonymous or logged in user can view
* ensure columns are retrieved in same order as they were created
* remove 'plus' from central if you don't have permission
* implement settings to point to custom bootstrap css URL
* implement menu setting so we can standardize menu as a default setting
* implement show/hide of columns
* implement order of columns in table view,
* enable user role based menu visibility
* ensure all roles of current user in current schema are returned
* upload files directly into postgresql
* class column in superclass so that can filter on type on export and query
* simplify multiple reference so better understandable how data looks like
* in schema editor, only show local attributes for subclass, not all
* fix graphql link in menu
* change password via ui possible
* enable overlapping composite foreign key for ref_array (trigger difficult!)
* ENSURE PASSWORD IS NOT IN THE LOGS
* download of extended class should include superclass values
* download of superclass should only include superclass records
* enable custom 'format' as way to allow decoration of primitive types such as 'hyperlink', 'email', 'ontology'
* fix alter column in case of composite key (difficult, overlapping columns)
* sanitize column and table identifiers to [_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z] (we support _ to replace all illegal characters)
* in table view, don't show subclass rows unless explicitly enabled
* add filter on refSelect in case of overlapping keys
* bookmarkable data explorer state, including back button
* add form elements that are not columns, such as sections (CONSTANT)
* add templates for row and record view to tables, including save as settings
* added theming options by incorporating scss bootstrap service
* changed excel to use streaming APIs to reduce danger of heapspace errors (still all is cached in mem so there are
  limits)
* can upload all subclasses within same Excel/CSV sheet (reduce lookup hell)
* implemented version number in the database to signal incompatible updates
* implement 'draft' so long forms can be saved even when not valid, only pkey is always required
* select for ref/ref_array popup should not show mg_ columns
* in forms show ref/ref_array/refback as checkboxes/radio buttons; show in multiple columns;
* make lookup editable
* in catalogue replace 'publications' lookup with a text area for the citation
* breaking change: mg_* columns
* first save draft with pkeys only
* Databank.type should only types relevant to conception (but we also want type on this position)
* oicd integration
* as admin can use user manager so I can update passwords for users
* check roundtrip download/update of data and model and settings ('all')
* enable tagging of tables as 'metadata' (or create seperate view for ontologies???)


### todo first


* test ERN data models against EMX2 (to see if we need additional visible/validation options)
* enable autosave; first only show pkey and then all items (like 'new' and 'save')
* add query option to per table csv/excel endpoints to download what you see

cohort catalogue

* in catalogue, change 'release' to 'model'
* in catalogue, seperate 'harmonized' and 'sourcevariables'
* implement order by in table view (not having sorting sucks!)

conception

* Enable column order to be different in subclasses????
* Databank.institution we would like custom refLabel
* Add refLabel as option in schema
* hide 'ontology' tables

### todo second

* enable a 'not null' filter
* for ref/ref_array/refback show only filter options for which you have values, incl counts
* extend catalogue to have all we need to replace lifecycle (i.e. tree filter view)
* hide mg_modifiedBy columns when not editor
* group subclasses in a tree? remodel repeated variables?

### todo next

* enable ref_array to have a 'format' in which it is shown as a sub table
* add favicon and fonts to the theme settings
* enable upload of logo and favicon files instead of linking them
* add audit trail log
* download using filter that is applied in explorer view
* filter option for 'null' and 'not_null'
* add custom roles with per table privileges
* add custom privileges based on policies (row level security)
* change graphql to have pageInfo{first,prev,next,last} pointers returned'
* custom roles, so I can grant priviliges on tables
* create env variable for admin password and add as option to helm chart to ease deploys (now need to change all the
  time)

### later

* postgresql cube index feature for aggregation views
* long running downloads as jobs
* test limits of large data => remove 'offset' and replace with 'after' so large offset doesn't slow down
* enable master/detail edit forms?
* ontology data type
* add properties/settings for each column (to put all extensions)
* investigate migrations (for in place upgrades when metadata tables change)
* per tabel , per rij en per kolom kunnen vragen of men 'edit' permissie heeft
* as user I can can get email when I lost my password
* consider parquet as import/export format
* bug, if I filter on refBack column it fails, must now select reback.other column
* create plugin system for services (todo: isolation? runtime loading?)
* known bug: if I set refBack for refarray to 'null' then ref is not updated!
* user interface for row level security
* more filter option s for array types (now only 'equals')
* improve graphqlError titles and messages
* merge Schema and SchemaMetadata and Table and TableMetadata
* column level permissions
* flattened result in graphql for tables, including group by
    * sorting on nested fields in graphql; showing graphql as flat table
    * csv result field for that flattened result
* Search should work on refBack columns
* group by
* graph mutation next to flat mutation
* decide if we need 'insert' seperate from 'update'
* complete metadata mutations
    * delete column
    * rename column, incl triggers
    * rename table, including triggers
* default limit to 10, maximize on 10.000
* add a check for maximum limit of identifiers, i.e. 63 characters (Excel limit)
* Default values
* Store the descriptions
* Finish the legacy reader
* column/per value validation, tuple/per row validation
* computed values?
* create validation procedure for Schema/Table/Column so we can give complete graphqlError messages and remove model
  checks from from SQL parts

### someday maybe

* throw graphqlError when webservice is called with only csv header and no values
* update is actually upsert (insert ... on conflict update) -> can we make it idempotent 'save' (how to update pkey
  then?)
* taskList api to have long running requests wrapped in a taskList. Should be same as normal api, but then wrapped
* reduce build+test times back to under a minute (LOL)
* decide to store both ends of ref; added value might be order of items and query speed
* cross-schema foreign keys, do we need/want those?
* postgresql queries exposed as readonly tables
