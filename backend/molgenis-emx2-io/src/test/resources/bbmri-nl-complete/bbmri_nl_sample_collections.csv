A retrospective cohort study of new users of blood glucose - lowering drugs (either oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin), who were 18 years or older was designed, and 1,609 patients were recruited through community pharmacies participating in PHARMO. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was confirmed by self-reported information from the participants. We have checked a small sample of 24 type 2 diabetes cases and 92% of these could be confirmed according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for diagnosing type 2 diabetes. From these 1,609 patients, 255 took part in the study, returned the questionnaire that had been sent to them, and donated blood for various assessments and DNA retrieval. Laboratory measurements included plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, non-fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c.

Demographic and clinical data were assessed at baseline (i.e. phenotype, extra intestinal manifestations, complications, medication, surgery, and pathology-, endoscopy- and radiology reports) and data have been updated biennially through chart review, questionnaires, and linkage to the Dutch resident registration. As of 2011, IBDSL is being scaled up into a cross-sectional, population based biobank, and focus expanded towards exploring underlying biologic mechanisms and molecular epidemiology.

Over 8000 people took part. The cohort study was concluded in 1990, but the data from the databank still provide useful information in the research into the origin of lung diseases. For instance, follow-up research into mortality in this cohort has resulted in the discovery that people with a higher airway sensitivity have a greater chance of dying from COPD. Research is currently being conducted into genetic causes of reduced lung function in the Vlagtwedde/Vlaardingen cohort. Reduced lung function is a normal phenomenon of ageing, but in some people it is accelerated. This can result in bronchial problems and diseases like COPD. UMCG researchers have found that the ADAM33 gene is responsible for an accelerated reduction in lung function in the population as a whole and in patients with asthma and (severe) COPD. This gene can therefore be considered a general lung-ageing gene.",,AAAACXPARPNKSACQK2ME25QAAE,503,74,AAAACXPASAS2AACQK2ME25QAAE,https://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/Researchers/Facilities/biobanks/biobanks/Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen/paginas/default.aspx,,,,,,,,

The disease has large impact on daily activities and quality of life. The heterogeneity of the pSS population is very large. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for optimal care of patients with pSS. The REgistry of Sjögren syndrome in Umcg – LongiTudinal (RESULT) cohort will combine up-to-date quality of care with gathering long-term prospective follow-up data in a large cohort of patients. Objective: Primary: To identify biomarkers and clinical parameters that determine and predict the longitudinal course of pSS, taking into account patient-reported, functional, imaging, histopathological, laboratory and genetic data. Secondary: A) To identify biomarkers and parameters that determine and predict the progression from early pSS to established pSS. B) To evaluate the effect of treatment of pSS in routine clinical practice and to identify predictors of response to treatment. C) To assess the diagnostic ability of salivary gland ultrasound in pSS and its applicability in monitoring disease activity and progression.  Study design: Longitudinal observational prospective cohort study.   Study population: All consecutive patients with confirmed or probable pSS who visit the outpatient clinic of the department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology in the UMCG are considered for this study. Inclusion period will be 5 years (expected inclusion of ±500 patients) and all patients will be followed up for 10 years.  Main study parameters: Clinical and patient-reported parameters, salivary and tear gland function, ultrasound and histopathology of salivary glands, laboratory parameters, immunological parameters in serum, saliva and tears, and genetic markers",,47,"48,49,50",74,AAAACXPASAS2AACQK2ME25QAAE,https://www.sjogrenexpertisecentrum.nl/,FALSE,FALSE,"For access, contact Frans Kroese",,FALSE,FALSE,"For access, contact Frans Kroese",

TNBC can be divided into at least two molecular entities; BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like. There are indications that TNBCs that are BRCA-like are more sensitive to bifunctional alkylating and platinum agents than non-BRCA-like TNBCs, and relatively resistant to taxanes. TNBCs have a relatively high mutational load, compared to other breast cancer subtypes, resulting in formation of neoantigens making this tumor type an attractive target for immunomodulatory drugs. Atezolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets human programmed deathligand 1 (PD-L1) has shown activity in TNBC. We hypothesize that by combining atezolizumab with paclitaxel or carboplatin-cyclophosphamide the desired rapid tumor control will be obtained with chemotherapy and subsequently atezolizumab can result in durable responses in a significant subset of patients. 
1.2 Objectives and endpoints: Validate the BRCA-like test in predicting differential progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1 definitions for measurable and non-measurable disease with first line alkylating and platinum agents (± antibody add-on) when compared to paclitaxel (± antibody add-on) in TNBC. Secondary: test whether the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy will result in more objective responses and a higher PFS. To define biomarkers that can predict for a PFS advantage of carboplatin-cyclophosphamide (± antibody add-on) and of paclitaxel (± antibody add-on) as first line palliative chemotherapy.
1.3 Trial design: This is a randomized phase IIb study testing two treatments by marker interaction designs.  A patient will receive either Carboplatin/ Cyclophosphamide (± atezolizumab add-on) or paclitaxel (± atezolizumab). When progression occurs, patient who did not received atezolizumab will be offered this in a cross over design.

The analysis methods for which the material will be used include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and other assays.

Furthermore, DNA from blood samples may serve as control DNA in case of sequencing or may be used for SNP analyses. Plasma will be used to measure cytokine profiles or other proteomic analyses. 
For these analyses it will be imperative to obtain material longitudinally.

- Clinical validation

2. Plasma biobank of longitudinally collected samples
NGS methods will be used to compare mutation profiles before and after systemic therapy, to study mutational events causing resistance to therapy.

Study population: 
Cancer patients, with a focus on metastatic disease treated with systemic therapy. Patients with localized disease can be included, however the current status of the technique appears to be more suitable for metastatic disease. Most patients will have tissue available for comparison with ctDNA mutations, or will undergo a biopsy in other protocols (e.g. CPCT-02).

Intervention:
Plasma collection at planned blood draw. In a small percentage of patients, a tissue biopsy will be done, if safely feasible. In rare cases, pleural or abdominal fluid will be collected by puncture.

Endpoints for clinical assay: 
-Reproducibility of qualitative identification of cancer mutations in ctDNA
-Reproducibility of quantitative analysis of specific mutations (e.g. BRAF V600E, KRAS codon 12)

Translational endpoints: 
-The percentage of patients with a mutation in a certain gene or pathway before/after therapy

Tumor organoids are three‐dimensional cultures of cancer stem cells that can now be established on an individual patient basis. If tumor organoids are able to predict sensitivity to treatment, this can prevent unnecessary exposure to toxic agents and result in improved patient selection for treatment with targeted agents.

Primary objectives:
• Evaluate the potential of tumor organoid therapy response to predict treatment response in the patient
• Design a standardized organoid screening test and propose a test threshold that ensures a high negative predictive value

Primary endpoints:
• Area under the (partial) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
• Optimal organoid screening test threshold and associated accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value)

Study design: This is a multicenter observational cohort study evaluating the feasibility of using tumor organoids as a screening tool to predict treatment response to standard of care agents in patients with metastatic colorectal or lung cancer. Patients will be asked to participate before they
start treatment with any kind of standard of care agent specified in this protocol. If patients consent to participation they will undergo a biopsy procedure of a metastatic lesion and a blood withdrawal before start of
treatment. The biopsy specimen will be used to culture tumor organoids, which will subsequently be incubated with the same standard of care treatment as has been given to the patient.

[1-4] No targeted therapies are currently available for this subgroup. Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is significantly higher in TNBC. [5, 6] Given the durable responses induced by the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in other advanced solid cancers, immunotherapeutic approaches, such as blockade of PD-1 by nivolumab may be the key to treat TNBC. Moreover, since classical anticancer agents can stimulate immune effector cells [7-9], we hypothesize that short-term induction treatment with radiation, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or cisplatin induces an anticancer immune response resulting in synergistic activity with nivolumab.
1.2 Objectives and endpoints To determine the activity of nivolumab after four different immune response induction treatments in TNBC patients with metastatic disease. Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints: overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit, overall survival, toxicity, immune-related toxicity.
1.3 Trial design This is a single center non-blinded randomized non-comparative phase II trial with an adaptive Simon two-stage design. [10] The first stage of the trial consists of five arms (4 with induction treatment followed by nivolumab, 1 with no induction treatment before nivolumab).

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of stratifying patients with locally advanced (incurable) or metastatic colorectal cancer for treatment with anticancer agents. This will be achieved by performing a comprehensive drug screen on every patient’s individual tumor organoids using a selected number of targeted agents supplied by the pharmaceutical industry. According to their individual organoid response profiles patients will be allocated to a particular treatment with an early phase (phase 1B or higher) or a currently registered compound that is consorted in this collective protocol.
Organoid response assays are currently estimated to take about 2-3 months. To bridge the analysis period, patients will receive standard of care treatment after inclusion and the subsequent biopsy procedure. When progressive disease is observed on standard of care treatment, our treatment stratification will be complete and patients will be allocated to a targeted agent. Patients for whom it was not possible to identify an active agent will be referred back to standard of care treatment or another experimental treatment. Patients are asked to undergo a post-treatment biopsy after progressing on standard of care treatment, this will allow us to evaluate if standard of care treatment has conferred resistance to the allocated agent if a patient does not respond to the experimental treatment. The post-treatment biopsy will only be performed if the patient has signed consent for treatment with the selected experimental agent and has passed baseline screening.

This biobank application covers for the generation of one large PBMC biobank based on all these studies. The current list of studies (which may be expanded over time):

N03LAM, N10TIL, M14TIL, N11RFA, N12INT, M11TCR, N12LON, N14ITO, N14IMR, M12PCA, N14OPC, M14PRT, N14MPN, N15TON, N14HPV, N12LAR, M11CIR, N15HTC, N15TCH, N15IMP

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be isolated from the blood and consist of many different types of immune cells. After PBMC isolation the immune cells can be studied; e.g. the ratio of different immune cell subsets, or the expression of certain surface molecules on these cells, or the specificity of the cells (in the case of T-cells) can be determined. These analyses are often performed using flowcytometry.
Many different intervention clinical trials study the response of immune cells to treatment over time by taking regular blood samples. In addition, there are a number of trials which are not designed to test the effect of a (drug) intervention, but purely to follow the immune responses. In these trials, blood is also taken from the patient for PBMC isolation, but no further interventions are performed.
In all cases peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated from the blood of patients. These cells contain the most important immune cells that can be studied. These PBMCs are then frozen and can be used for subsequent research. 
The proposed PBMC biobank will consist of all these PBMC isolations resulting from separate studies. It is important to work with one biobank code, instead of a separate biobank code for each independent trial in which PBMCs are isolated, because over time patients are often included in multiple studies; using one biobank code for PBMCs ensures that it is easy to trace all PBMC samples of the patient over time and not just the samples of when the patient was in study x or y (eg patients can be included in a drug intervention study and at the same time be included in the N03LAM general material sampling study or a patient can fail in one study and then be included in the next study).

In parallel to PBMC isolation, 2 x 0.5 ml wholeblood is isolated from each sample as well. The wholeblood can be used for DNA isolation, for example to determine the HLA-subtype of the patient (a parameter often needed for immunological analyses). By isolating DNA from the wholeblood, PBMCs can be ‘saved’ for the actual immunological assays. This biobank application applies for biobanking of the wholeblood. The biobanking of the PBMCs is arranged in a separate application.

Alternatively, tumor material can be frozen in very small PDX fragments, which at a later timepoint could be transplanted in mice to grow tumor samples so that e.g. immune responses to the tumor can be tested.
Many different intervention clinical trials study the response of immune cells in the tumor to treatment by analyzing tumor biopsies or leftover tumor material. In addition, there are a number of trials which are not designed to test the effect of a (drug) intervention, but purely to follow the immune responses in the tumor itself. In all cases, tumor biopsies or leftover tumor tissue is taken from the patient for digestion to single cell suspension or freezing of PDX fragments.
The proposed tumor digest/PDX immunology biobank will consist of all these tumor single cell digestion products or PDX fragments resulting from separate studies. It is important to work with one biobank code, instead of a separate biobank code for each independent trial in which tumor material is isolated for digestion or PDX, because over time patients are often included in multiple studies; using one biobank code ensures that it is easy to trace all samples of the patient over time and not just the samples of when the patient was in study x or y (eg patients can be included in a drug intervention study and at the same time be included in the N03LAM general material sampling study or a patient can fail in one study and then be included in the next study). In some cases there is a sample taken from the patient at the end of study x, which can nicely be used as a pre-treatment sample for study y. Using separate biobank codes for separate studies it will be much more difficult to find this out.

In short:
Melanoma patients with regional lymphatic metastases (stage III melanoma), for which the primary treatment is surgical resection, have a high risk of progression to distant metastasis and death (five-year survival of 40-78%). However, a significant proportion of patients remains disease-free after surgery. Identifying which patients have a high chance of relapse would allow us to treat these patients with adjuvant therapies, diminishing the chance of relapse. While there exist several clinical parameters that roughly predict chance of relapse, these are not very precise and cannot be used to assess risk on a case by case basis. 

There is a clear need for a better understanding of melanoma progression, which can eventually lead to the development of biomarkers or even new treatments. There is a complex interplay between tumor, tumor microenvironment and host immune response, which will have to be elucidated further to make this possible. This requires the longitudinal study of blood and tumor samples. All patients with lymphatic metastases undergo surgical resection. These metastases range from micrometastases to multiple large, palpable lymph nodes or extensive in-transit metastases. Especially for patients with palpable lymph node metastases or in-transit metastases, the general size of these lesions means that after pathological examination, there remains an abundance of tumor material that can be used for research, with an intact tumor microenvironment. Moreover, these patients have a high chance of progression to distant metastasis, which makes this an ideal patient category to study disease progression. Patients that do not step will present an ideal control group. Analysis of these tumor samples and subsequent distant metastases can yield a wealth of information on melanoma disease behavior and progression. Moreover, on-treatment biopsies can be collected to better understand response to different treatments and find biomarkers for response.",,AAAACXSW445KYACQK2MBZ5YAAE,"AAAACXSW47CFYACQK2MBZ5YAAM,AAAACXSW45VK6ACQK2MBZ5YAAM",81,AAAACXSW447PSACQK2MBZ5YAAM,,,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,,TRUE,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,

These problems and symptoms are thought to be related to cerebral shortage of the serotonin precursor tryptophan, that is depleted by peripheral overproduction by the tumour. The clinical manifestation of serotonin (5-HT) overproduction (diarrhoea, flushes and wheezing) is known as carcinoid syndrome (CS) which can be present in metastasized (M1) ileal NET tumours. The exact role of 5-HT metabolism in psychopathology, however, is still unclear.
Objective: This study aims to assess impairments in cognition and psychiatric function in patients with metastatic ileal NET and relate this to 5-HT metabolism, by investigating the relation between psychiatric and cognitive function to peripheral 5-HT production. 
The study has two main objectives: First, to study the relation between cognitive function and peripheral 5-HT production, second, to study the relation between the severity of depressive symptoms and peripheral 5-HT production. 
Secondary objectives are to assess psychiatric diagnoses within the patient group and relate them to 5-HT production and to assess the severity of irritability and its relation to 5-HT production.

Exploratory objective: Data collection for biobanking for future research questions
- Blood sample for circulating tumour DNA
- Blood sample for genotyping (eg. polymorphism in serotonin transporter genes)
- Future analysis of other measurements of in the serotonergic pathway, such as TRP or metabolites of 5-HT in blood and urine

NET is a rare tumor, and this study is the first to combine and to relate standardized cognitive and psychiatric testing with measurements of 5HT metabolism. As very little is known about the relation between 5HT metabolism, medication and symptoms, we want to increase the possibility to answer future research questions by biobanking blood and urine samples.

AAAACXU2EIJD4ACQK2MBZ5YAAE,BAVL62 Determining the sensitivity and specificity of circulating tumor cells and cytology in cerebrospinal fluid of patients clinically suspected for leptomeningeal metastases,BAVL62,"COHORT,DISEASE_SPECIFIC",urn:miriam:icd:II,BIOLOGICAL_SAMPLES,"SERUM,WHOLE_BLOOD,DNA,OTHER_MATERIAL_TYPE",OTHER_EXP_DATA_TYPE,NASK,,,,2000,"Background: Two to eight percent of patients with solid tumors develop tumor metastases in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), also known as leptomeningeal metastases (LM). Diagnosis of LM is often based on clinical symptoms and typical contrast enhancement of the leptomeninges on MRI of brain and/or spine. However, MRI has a low sensitivity (0.76) and specificity (0.77) for the diagnosis of LM. When MRI results are inconclusive, a lumbar puncture is performed to obtain CSF. Sensitivity of CSF cytology is also low: 55% at first lumbar puncture, increasing to 80% upon second sampling. 
In the recent years, new methods of solid tumor cell detection in blood and CSF have been developed. One method is  the Cell Search System (Veridex) that showed sensitivity rates up to of 100% and  specificity rates up to 97.2% for the detection of Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) positive tumor cells in CSF. Another method is EpCAM based immunoflow cytometry with also high  sensitivity and specificity rates (76-80% and 84- 96% respectively). At the NKI-AvL, an improved EpCAM-based immunoflow cytometry assay was developed to detect CTCs. In a small group of cancer patients with a clinical suspicion on LM and a negative or non-conclusive MRI (n=29) a 100% sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of LM was found. In comparison, CSF cytology showed 61.5% sensitivity and  100% specificity in the same patients group. The immunoflow cytometry assay was adapted for  melanoma patients by using an antibody melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) instead of EpCAM. 

Goals study The primary goal of the study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of immunoflow cytometry versus cytology in  CSF of patients that have a history of a (metastasized) epithelial tumor or melanoma and will undergo a lumbar puncture because of a clinical suspicion on LM. Secondary goals are (1) to determine the CSF penetration of targeted and immunotherapeutic agents, when patients are treated with these medicines and (2) to detect tumor mutations in ctDNA and isolated tumorcells from CSF. 

Study design: We enroll patients that treated at the NKI-AVL or MC Slotervaart in Amsterdam and at the Oscar Lambret Cancer Center, Lille in whom a lumbar puncture and venipuncture is clinically indicated for CSF and blood collection.  We  both include CSF and blood samples from patients with a  (clinical) suspicion on LM, and from patients that have a suspicion of a non-malignant neurological disease, eg. infectious or auto-immune meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (control group) (MC Slotervaart). 
From every patient a sample of 1 x 6 ml of CSF for laboratory assessments (cell count, chemistry, ctDNA), 1 x 5 ml of CSF for cytology, 2 x 5 ml of CSF for immune flowcytometry , 1 x 2 ml of CSF for drug quantification (in total 23 ml CSF per sampling) will be obtained.
After the LP, 2x8ml serum for blood cell count and chemistry and 2x10 mL for ctDNA mutation measurement, 1x8 ml sample of whole blood for CTC determination in blood and 1 x 4 ml plasma or serum for drug quantification will be drawn (in total 48 ml blood per sampling). 
If more lumbar punctures are clinically indicated, the same CSF/blood sampling as stated above will be performed. If available, archived primary tumor tissue will be obtained for EpCam/MCSP staining.

Inclusion of patients: The study started in May 2012 as the N12CLM study. This study will now continue as the B16BLM biobank study. Inclusion rate is expected to be 2 patients/month.

AAAACXVECGGBUACQK2MBZ5YAAE,BAVL61 Biobank voor genetische biomarker analyse van weefsel/bloed van patiënten met een HPV-negatieve tumor in het hoofd-halsgebied.,BAVL61,"COHORT,DISEASE_SPECIFIC",urn:miriam:icd:II,BIOLOGICAL_SAMPLES,"WHOLE_BLOOD,TISSUE_PARAFFIN_EMBEDDED,TISSUE_FROZEN",OTHER_EXP_DATA_TYPE,NASK,,,,1000,"Kanker in het hoofdhalsgebied, de keel, mondholte of het strottenhoofd is een zeer ernstige en levensbedreigende aandoening, zeker wanneer de tumor in een wat meer gevorderd stadium is. Er zijn twee geaccepteerde behandelingen voor een gevorderd stadium hoofdhalskanker: ofwel chirurgie met nabestraling, ofwel een combinatie van bestraling met of zonder gelijktijdige medicatie (radiosensitizer). Het zijn allebei ingrijpende behandelingen maar patiënten verkiezen toch vaak bestraling al dan niet met of zonder een radiosensitizer. Bijna de helft van de patiënten is niet genezen na bestraling in combinatie met een radiosensitizer. Die patiënten hadden naar verwachting beter behandeld kunnen worden met chirurgie en nabestraling, of post-operatieve chemoradiatie of een andere therapie. Helaas kunnen we niet voorspellen welke tumor goed reageert op radiotherapie met of zonder radiosensitizer. 

In dit project zoeken we daarom biomarkers op basis van genetische, pathologische en klinische factoren. Als op basis van biomarkers kan worden aangegeven dat er een grote kans is dat de tumor terug komt na bestraling met of zonder radiosensitizer, dan is de keuze voor een andere behandeling wellicht beter. Patiënten beslissen over de behandeling die ze ondergaan op advies van de behandelend arts. Helaas zijn er tot op heden weinig diagnostische mogelijkheden om subpopulaties met een slechtere response op de huidige standaard behandelingen te identificeren. Om deze reden is onderzoek naar tumorweefsel en bloed bij hoofd-halskanker patiënten van groot belang.


Patiënten met een advanced stage (III/IV) hpv-negatieve oropharynx, larynx en hypopharynx tumor die behandeld worden middels radiotherapie met of zonder combinatie van chemo of andere medicatie komen in aanmerkingen voor deze biobank. De biobank heeft als doel biomarkers te identificeren en valideren die de response op therapie kunnen voorspellen. Een exacte vraag is nog niet te formuleren aangezien het een deels exploratieve en validerende onderzoeksvraag betreft. Momenteel vinden retrospectieve analyses plaats welke met gegevens uit deze biobank dienen te worden gevalideerd. Inzameling van het weefsel komt overeen met de inzameling volgens het B15HHC protocol met inachtneming van de hierboven geformuleerde inclusiecriteria. 
Kortgezegd, alle patiënten die voldoen aan de inclusiecriteria die komen voor een eerste afspraak op de poli Hoofd & Hals Oncologie & Chirurgie krijgen de informatiebrief over het verzamelen van weefsel voor een biobank. De arts-assistenten/nurse practitioner/fellows/hoofd-hals chirurgen geven deze brief. Indien de patiënt heeft besloten weefsel af te staan, wordt het ic-formulier gescand en komt het in het elektronisch patiëntendossier. Op de operatiedag moet de hoofd-halschirurg in Chipsoft controleren of het ic-formulier getekend is ja/nee (gaat de patiënt akkoord met het verzamelen van de biopten). Indien mogelijk worden er 2 biopten tumor vries, 2 biopten tumor paraffine en 2 biopten normaal weefsel  afgenomen. Er is een oranje HHC pathologie Research formulier vervaardigd door Dr. Lotje Zuur voor op de operatiekamer en hierop wordt aangegeven welke weefselsamples verzameld zijn voor welke studie/biobank. Het weefsel en oranje formulier worden na de operatie opgehaald en ingeleverd bij de afdeling pathologie. Aan het weefsel wordt een code gekoppeld en met behulp van deze code is het weefsel terug te vinden. De code van het weefsel is gekoppeld aan de betreffende TRION code (B17GEN). Het afnemen van 1 extra buis bloed zal plaatsvinden tijdens de standaard bloedafname voor het stellen van de diagnose/ opstellen van het behandelplan. Voor het afnemen van 1 extra buis bloed geldt een verwijzing naar het reeds bestaande en goedgekeurde protocol P09BIO.
Samples zullen zoveel mogelijk in een batch verwerkt worden om zo batcheffecten te voorkomen. De FFPE biopten zullen worden verwerkt voor DNA en Fresh-frozen materiaal voor RNA en DNA next-generation sequencing. Het bloed zal hierbij fungeren als controle voor het DNA mutatiepatroon. Het normaal weefsel zal fungeren als controle voor het RNA expressie patroon. Het paraffine materiaal zal worden gebruikt voor immunohistochemie.",,AAAACXSW445KYACQK2MBZ5YAAE,"AAAACXVECGFM6ACQK2MBZ5YAAI,AAAACXVECGFUGACQK2MBZ5YAAE",81,AAAACXSW447PSACQK2MBZ5YAAM,,,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,,TRUE,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,

DCIS is considered a precursor of invasive breast cancer and mostly treated as such, with surgery and, in case of breast conserving surgery, radiotherapy. Despite the increased incidence of DCIS, the incidence of invasive breast cancer has not declined. This implies that DCIS does not always step into invasive carcinoma, resulting in overtreatment of at least part of patients diagnosed with screen-detected DCIS. To test this hypothesis, a randomized, international multicenter, open-label, phase III non-inferiority trial was set up by Elshoff et al (LORD-trial), and has recently started including women. The LORD-trial will compare standard treatment with active surveillance in 1240 women aged ⩾ 45 years with asymptomatic, screen-detected, pure low-grade DCIS based on vacuum-assisted biopsies of calcifications only. Both study arms will be monitored with annual digital mammography for a period of 10 years. The primary end-point is 10-year ipsilateral invasive breast cancer free percentage. Currently, the LORD-trial is open for inclusion in eight Dutch centers and more are to open  in the coming months. In addition, multiple centers in different European countries will start accrual within the next year
As expected, not all women want to be randomized and not all women are randomized to the study arm of their personal preference. As a consequence, a minority of women (estimated about 25% as outlined in the statistics section of the LORD-trial protocol) decide to undergo either conventional treatment or active surveillance rather than participate in the randomized study. To avoid loss of crucial information from these women regarding their perceptions and reasons for their individual choices, to collect and analyze their tissue samples and to monitor their follow-up, it is essential that these women give consent to participate in the proposed prospective observational study. For this study, identical inclusion criteria apply as for the LORD-trial. 
The potential study participant will be offered at participation in the LORD-trial. If the patient does not want to participate in the trial due to a strong preference for one of the study arms, the patient will be offered the alternative non-randomized observational study.
In conclusion, the aim is to utilize highly important data complementary to the LORD-trial, crucial to evaluate and improve the management of low grade DCIS.",,AAAACXSW445KYACQK2MBZ5YAAE,"AAAACYBQNVUU6ACQK2MBZ5YAAM,AAAACX57XRDFCACQK2MBZ5YAAM",81,AAAACXSW447PSACQK2MBZ5YAAM,,,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,,TRUE,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,

aaaaczxxvjrz4acqk2mo6qaaae,BAVL105 POINTING: Towards patient-tailored cancer immunotherapy supported by a multifaceted predictive signature composed of integrative omics and molecular imaging,BAVL105,"COHORT,DISEASE_SPECIFIC",urn:miriam:icd:II,BIOLOGICAL_SAMPLES,OTHER_MATERIAL_TYPE,OTHER_EXP_DATA_TYPE,NASK,,,,21000,"SUMMARY 
Rationale: Immunotherapy is a novel, rapidly evolving field, with several drugs and combinations under development. Cancer treatment is being revolutionized by these drugs due to broad activity across a variety of cancers, leading to remarkable and durable responses. Unfortunately, no validated tools are available to predict which patients will benefit from these expensive drugs or will experience life-threatening toxicity. Patient selection based on factors such as Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and somatic mutations in tumor biopsies still undervalues the complexity and dynamics of immune response. 
Objective: Primary objective: To develop and validate multifaceted predictive signatures for anti PD-1 antibody effects using relevant components of integrative omics (histology, immunohistochemistry, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics and molecular imaging), that predict which patients have a ≤ 5% chance of responding to PD-1 antibody. Secondary objective: Relationship between a multifaceted signature and toxicity. 
Study design: This is a two-center prospective continuously accruing longitudinal cohort study in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma eligible for standard anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. After successful eligibility screening, all patients will undergo i) a biopsy for whole genome sequencing, IHC, DNA and RNA analysis ii) venous blood sampling for routine assessments and exploratory biomarker analysis, iii) feces sampling, and iv) CT scan, MRI brain, and whole body or total body FDG-PET, according to standard diagnostic criteria and response measurement criteria. 
Data on medication, side effects of treatment, and results from routine assessments will be derived from the electronical patient dossier. Blood samples for exploratory biomarker analysis will be isolated and stored until analysis of for example circulating tumor DNA, peptide profiling, circulating miRNA, cytokine bead assay chemokine profile, cell free tumor DNA changes upon treatment et cetera. The tumor biopsy, venous blood sampling and feces collection will ideally be performed before, during and at the end of standard anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. The data from this prospective longitudinal cohort will be used in the POINTING (towards patient –tailored cancer immunotherapy supported by a multifaceted predictive signature composed of integrative omics and molecular imaging) KWF Kankerbestrijding project. The goal of this project is to develop a multifaceted predictive signature, by using new techniques on tumor characteristics before and during treatment with immune therapy. To do so, researchers will use the ‘omics’ approach. By combining molecular omics comprising genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics with radiomics and molecular imaging a set of factors will arise which can accurately predict the outcome of the treatment. 
Study population: Patients with metastatic NSCLC or metastatic melanoma with an indication for the standard of care anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. Together, the NKI-AVL and UMCG will recruit yearly ~500 patients in the NSCLC cohort and ~200 patients in the melanoma cohort. 
Main study parameters/endpoints: A multifaceted predictive signature by combining molecular omics comprising genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics with radiomics and molecular imaging. 
Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: All necessary information on the subjects will be extracted from the (electronic) patient dossier. The risk of blood drawings and stool sampling are considered negligible. Review of the literature shows that in general tumor biopsies can be performed with only minor complications and acceptable risks. Although patients do not directly benefit from this study, results of this study will be valuable for the understanding of the tumor immune response and will guide further prospective research and patient selection thereafter. The purpose of POINTING is to personalize potentially curative immunotherapy, thereby avoiding possibly harmful exposure by these drugs of patients who will not benefit.

Two of the key interests of the NKI-AVL are immunotherapy and personalized medicine. The results from this study can contribute in both these fields and therefore fits the NKI research strategy",,AAAACXSW445KYACQK2MBZ5YAAE,"AAAACXSW46AVWACQK2MBZ5YAAE,AAAACXSW45CR6ACQK2MBZ5YAAE",81,AAAACXSW447PSACQK2MBZ5YAAM,,,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,,TRUE,TRUE,Access fee and 'joint project' depends on the request details and collaborative initiatives,
