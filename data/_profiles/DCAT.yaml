name: "W3C's Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2"
description: "DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. DCAT enables a publisher to describe datasets and data services in a catalog using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs. This can increase the discoverability of datasets and data services. It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process. See: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/"
