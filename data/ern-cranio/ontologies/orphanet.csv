The phenotype is variable depending on the particular mutation. Two distinct presentations have been described: (1) an early infantile onset severe phenotype with delayed walking and motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCV) <10 m/s, often referred to as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (see this term), or (2) a much later onset phenotype (>age 40), with normal or mildly slowed MNCV and more frequent hearing loss and pupillary abnormalities.

Usually the knees are the earliest and most affected muscles. In advanced stages, involvement of the shoulder girdle (resulting in scapular winging) and the distal muscle groups are observed.

The mother had two spontaneous abortions (at 6 and 12 weeks gestation) but gave birth to a normal girl, suggesting an autosomal or X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Although the parents were not known to be consanguineous, they shared a French-Canadian and American Indian ethnic origin.","https://identifiers.org/orphanet:1046","ORPHA:377789"

Newborns are usually preterm infants with low birth-weights, that encounter feeding difficulties (including vomiting with initial feeds, which may later worsened and the abdomen becomes progressively distended) as well as failure to thrive. Affected children present disrupted bowel loops assuming a spiral configuration resembling an 'apple peel' and may have less than half of the normal length of the small bowel and a physiologically short bowel. Atresia of small intestine is characterized by jejunal atresia near the ligament of Treitz, foreshortened bowel, and a large mesenteric gap. The bowel distal to the atresia is precariously supplied. Atresia of small intestine may be a manifestation of cystic fibrosis (see this term). The most important cause of mortality is short bowel syndrome (see this term), encountered in 65% of cases.","https://identifiers.org/orphanet:1201","ORPHA:377791"

When severe iodine deficiency occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with congenital hypothyroidism that is manifested by increased neonatal morbi-mortality and severe mental dysfunction, hyperactivity, attention disorders and a substantial decrease of IQ of an irreversible nature. Excessive iodine ingestion during the third trimester of pregnancy can result in hypothyroidism and fetal goiter due to a prolonged inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, an increase in thyrotropin (TSH).","https://identifiers.org/orphanet:1910","ORPHA:377789"

Facial skin contains numerous folds, as in the cutis laxa syndrome. Umbilical or inguinal hernias have also been described. Dermatosparaxis is extremely rare and few cases only have been reported. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. It is due to N-terminal procollagen I peptidase deficiency causing abnormal maturation of the alpha1 (I) and alpha2 (I) collagen I pro-chains, in which the aminoterminal propeptide is incorrectly cleaved. The causative gene, ADAMTS2, has been localised to 5q23. The homozygous mutation Q225X was present in 80% of cases subjected to molecular analysis.

Other features include CNS malformations (agenesis of corpus callosum and acqueductal stenosis), lung anomalies (absent lung lobulation), complex cardiac malformations, and unicornis uterus. These infants also show facial dysmorphism and ear anomalies. The condition is a rare with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

Eleven documented cases have been reported in the literature, affecting older children and young adults. In contrast to the classic form of temporal arteritis, it is not a systemic disease nor does it cause local symptoms at the temporal area. The term JTA was coined by Lie and his colleagues, in 1975, when they reported four cases of an otherwise asymptomatic disease presenting with a painless nodule at the temporal region. None of the cases showed evidence of systemic disease or history of trauma to the temporal region. Excisional biopsy of the lesions revealed a non-giant cell granulomatous inflammation of the temporal arteries with eosinophilic infiltration, intimal proliferation and microaneurysmal disruption of the media. JTA has a benign clinical course, is treated by surgical excision and does not recur.","https://identifiers.org/orphanet:26137","ORPHA:377788"
