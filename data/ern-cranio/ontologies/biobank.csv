The most frequently represented domains are Rheumatology, Oncology and Hepato-gastro-enterology.In the last five years, most of the collections have been in the constitution phase, not yet in the analytical phase. However, some collections have been analysed and the results seem interesting. This is the case for the following studies:-the FAKIR study promoted by the CHRU of Tours: Variability of the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics relationship of infliximab in rheumatoid polyarthritis : this study involved a clinical service (the Rheumatology service) and a research team (the GICC : Genetique Immunotherapie Chimie et Cancer)-the PEPIT study promoted by the CHRU of Tours : Study protocole of the passage of immunoglobulins transplacentally : this study involved a clinical service (the Rheumatology service) and a research team (the GICC)-the STORI study promoted by the GETAID (Groupe d'Etudes Therapeutiques des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif) : Prospective study of the predictive factors of remission maintenance in Crohn's disease after stopping the infliximab treatmentIn 2010, new clinical services have started to call upon the competencies of the CRB so we should be able to extend our scientific activity to the domains of Cardiology and Pneumology.","https://www.chu-tours.fr/presentation-du-crb-de-touraine.html","France"

Using a biochemical assay with successive protein enrichment from frozen brain slices, we isolated ferritin light and heavy chains in a so far not known dominant autosomal disease. Our studies have provided additional knowledge and insights in the growing area of ferritin-related neurodegeneration disease. In the field of Creutzfeldt jakob disease, we provide an alternative biochemical definition of PrPSc diversity and new insights in the perception of Human TSE agents' variability. Different brain areas from 41 sCJD and 12 iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) cases (mainly from the Cerebrotheque de Toulouse) were investigated, using two new biochemical assays. We developed several clinical research projects on Alzheimer disease regarding different points: - Anti-amyloid-beta immunization. Besides descrpition of neuropathological lesions, we contributed to a work concluding on the impact of amyloid clearance restablishment on neurite curvature. These data agree with preclinical animal studies and demonstrate that vaccination does not merely clear amyloid from the Alzheimer's disease brain, but reduces some of the neuronal alterations that characterize Alzheimer's disease.- Sphingoloipid molecules implicated in apoptosis. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) has a critical role in regulation of survival of neurons. A previous work on culture cells in our research team (INSERM U858), showed that in vitro, neuronal loss was induced by ?-amyloid peptide 25-35 and it was correlated with alteration of sphingolipid biostat. Our hypothesis is that SphK1 is differentially expressed in neurons regarding their location in the vicinity or far from amyloid deposits in the brain of patients affected with AD. In an on-going national clinical research project (directed by Pr MB Delisle), our general objective is to precise on human brain material, the role of SphK1 in relation to neuronal loss and ?-amyloid location.","http://www.chu-toulouse.fr/catalogue-du-crb-tbr","France"

Beyond the STANISLAS Cohort, this latest integrated other populations and particularly, a population of hypertensive patients. Actually, always in the same direction, we are interested in an integrative approach which takes into consideration: 1) the different metabolic pathways involved in the CVD, 2) a great number of information on genetics, mRNA and circulating proteins and 3) the intermediate phenotypes in the plasma/serum as well as in the PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) (bank of RNA and protein extracts of PBMCs in the 3rd recruitment of the STANISLAS Cohort, during 2003-2005). In 2008, we associated to this strategy which was essentially focused on the candidate-gene approach, the pangenomic approach. This approach, which enables revealing new loci related to disease, opened new perspectives to our CRB. First, a collaboration with a multi-centric character, with aim to detect new genetic loci in Europeans, which gave new exciting scientific results and enriched our CRB (we regrouped genotyping, phenotypic data and/or biological samples).

"bbmri-eric:ID:FR_BB-0033-00050","CRB institutionnel Centre Leon Berard","CRB-CLB","The identification of key events during tumor development has led to innovative therapeutic approaches targeting critical defective pathways (hence the notion of ""targeted therapy""). However, the exclusive targeting of mitogenic mechanisms has shown two crucial limitations: the emergence of chemo-resistance within target cells and evasion promoted by tumor heterogeneity. In this context, the researchers and clinicians involved in this project share the will to focus their studies on intrinsic and extrinsic determinants that allow pre-cancer and cancer cells to escape from onco-suppressive barriers (apoptosis, senescence, interactions with the immune system and the microenvironment), with the aim to develop innovative therapeutic approaches designed to specifically target cancerous cell survival processes. The foundations of this project can thus be found in the scientific links that have been forged over the past few years between the diverse INSERM and CNRS units present on the site (INSERM Unit 590, UMR CNRS 5238, UMR CNRS 5201, INSERM Unit 865, and INSERM Unit 871), in the framework of this restricted but promising aspect of cancer research. Hence, above and beyond cancer research that unifies the different groups, the members of these various laboratories have expressed the will to define and develop common priority research themes:-The study of mechanisms of tumoral escape. The aim of this research axis, within the framework of specific tumor types (breast cancers, intestinal tumors, pancreatic tumors, virally-induced hepatic tumors, sarcomas, neuroblastomas, hematological malignancies), is to identify the mechanisms that allow cancerous cells to evade the intrinsic safeguard responses of the cell. It comprises three sub-themes with numerous interrelations both in conceptual terms and in terms of applied research:osub-theme 1 is the characterization of mechanisms allowing cancers to avoid intrinsic onco suppressive processes (senescence and apoptosis);osub theme 2 is the analysis of mechanisms of avoiding immuno surveillance;osub-theme 3 is the pre-clinical evaluation that the re-engagement of these safeguard mechanisms can be promising therapeutic approaches. The long-term objective is to improve understanding of the involvement of these mechanisms in the processes of tumor progression, metastasis and chemo-resistance, so as to be able to propose innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring these safety systems and identifying new diagnostic and predictive factors. -Analysis of the perversion of information flow by the carcinogenic process. In multi-cellular organisms, the continuous integration of signals from the microenvironment by normal cells requires the onset of specific genetic programs which express information stored in the hereditary material and, through transcription and translation, transfer this information to the effector molecules. At each step, major and multiple differences between normal and cancer cells are evidenced. The objective of this research theme is the identification of those differences that may be instrumental in determining the phenotypic divergence between normal and malignant states. These programs are recognized as being innovative and involving collaboration between groups. As such they form part of the priority research approaches cancer cluster CLARA (Canceropole Lyon-Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne). The approach ""Tumoral Escape"" forms the core of the research program of the Fondation de Cooperation Scientifique ""Synergie Lyon Cancer"" (Scientific Cooperation Foundation ""Lyon Cancer Synergy"") created in 2007 following the nationwide call for proposals from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, in order to create the Reseau Thematique de Recherche et de Soins (RTRS) (Thematic Network Research and Care). Furthermore, the work on the role of immunosurveillance as well as the analysis of virally induced cancers are developed within the framework of the scientific priorities of the Fondation ""Innovations en Infectiologie"" (FINOVI) and the Lyon Biopole, thereby creating close links between research themes of the sites of Lyon-Est and Lyon Sud-Gerland.","http://www.centreleonberard.fr/827-Les-plateformes-de-recherche-de-transfert.clb.aspx?language=fr-FR","France"

Our studies have been developed following 3 main directions:-) Identification of caspase-independent cell death as a new means to overcome apoptosis avoidance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) : Drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure in CLL. In search for new molecules that induce PCD via caspase-independent PCD targets and that could open the way to novel therapeutic strategies in CLL treatment, we focused on CD47. This protein is a widely expressed member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, functioning both as a receptor for thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and as a ligand for the transmembrane signal regulatory proteins SIRP? and ?. Our results demonstrate that CD47 engagement in CLL cells is a new and original approach that may be used to specifically eliminate malignant B-lymphocytes by induction of caspase-independent PCD, and this even in CLL cells from drug refractory patients. -) Characterization of various chromosomal aberrations in CLL and other lymphoproliferative disorders: We identified the gain of the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p) as a frequent recurring chromosome aberration, present in 28% of untreated patients with advanced stage CLL  and the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 14. We also described the clinical and biological features of CLL patients with translocations involving IG genes that are recurrent, but uncommon (<5%) in CLL: (14;19)(q32;q13) and t(14;18)(q32;q21).

"bbmri-eric:ID:FR_BB-0033-00079","EVA (European Virus Archive)","-","Virus collections have been generated in small and large laboratories globally. However, their quality and the particular viruses collected usually reflect the interest of the laboratory.  Moreover, when laboratories are re-organized, closed down or the virologist leaves or retires, many of these collections are lost to science. The European Virus Archive (EVA) was conceived as a direct response to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organizations and industry, initially within Europe but ultimately throughout the World.  In preparing the FP7 proposal, it was emphasized that it would be impossible to generate a wide ranging viral archive in a single laboratory complex. Thus, the ""virology club tradition"" was retained by developing an integrated infrastructure via consortia, operating through validated networks. Initially, 9 laboratories within the EU were directly associated to compose the core of the network.  EVA provides access to viruses through European laboratories by integrating their collections and devising validated protocols and effective dissemination procedures, the partner laboratories work to identical high standards in producing and supplying authenticated viruses to the scientific community globally. This has been obtained through intense exchanges of know-how consisting of workshops, trainings and staff exchanges. The current EVA organization is satisfactorily operating: about 1000 products have been distributed worldwide. Ultimately, the EVA network should generate the largest collection of animal and plant viruses in Europe and ultimately in the world and should move beyond the current state-of-the-art to provide a valuable resource and service. To reach its objective to become the key provider of virus and viral derived products worldwide, EVA expands its network at the European level but also outside Europe.","http://www.european-virus-archive.com","France"

These samples are available for research into MND and associated conditions such as fronto-temporal dementia only.    The UK MND Collections combines more than 3,000 biological samples and accompanying clinical information; as well as epidemiology data from 400 participants, including people with MND, controls and family members.    The DNA Bank was the original Collection of whole genome DNA from over 3,000 blood samples, which are stored at CIGMR (Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research) in Manchester, UK. The DNA Bank also has clinical information (divided into a minimum and extended dataset) which is available to researchers.    The Cell Lines Collection offers a sub set of the DNA Bank samples as EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This was originally set up as an everlasting supply of DNA, with the lymphoblastoid cell lines now available to researchers to help them understand how the disease is developing.    The Epidemiology Collection has just over 200 patient and matched control blood samples with extensive environmental and lifestyle data (both from self-report questionnaires and telephone interviews) available to researchers.    More information on the DNA and cell bank is available in Smith et al BMC Genetics (2015) 16:84.","https://www.mndassociation.org/research/for-researchers/ukmndcollections/","United Kingdom"

This was achieved by establishing a biorepository and clinical research database. The biorepository is housed in the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, directed by Dr John McLauchlan and managed by Dr Sarah McDonald. Samples have been obtained from around 10,000 patients.    Access to samples and data is governed by a Tissue and Data Access Committee (TDAC). These are reviewed for ethical and scientific merit by TDAC and a decision reached.     Serum and plasma are obtained from all patients in the cohort. Buffy coats are also collected, and DNA can be extracted when required. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PAXgene tubes are held for smaller cohorts of patients. The extensive clinical data collected complements the biorepository and allows selection of samples from patients with characteristics of interest.    Sub-cohorts:  • Serial samples from patients who were treated as part of the NHS England Early Access Program.  • Yearly samples from cirrhotic patients (beginning 2015)  • Spontaneous resolvers  • Small paediatric cohort    Clinical Data  • Basic demographics incl place of birth and ethnicity  • History of HCV infection including exposure to risk factors and dates  • Date of diagnosis, date of first attendance at clinic  • Co-morbidites and co-medications at time of enrolment  • Liver disease status and how diagnosed  • Treatment status at enrolment;   • Social history including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis; BMI  • HCV RNA status, viral load and genotype/subtype  • Historical data from the patients' notes regarding previous treatment episodes (dates, regimen, viral loads, outcome) and liver biopsies  • Laboratory data including imaging and fibroscan;  • New treatment episodes and changes in liver disease status are recorded over time, as are any newly developed co-morbidities.

"bbmri-eric:contactID:UK_GBR-1-14","Wales Cancer Bank","","The Wales Cancer Bank (WCB) was set up in 2004 and consented the first patient in 2005. The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.    A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.    Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.    The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality    The WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.","http://walescancerbank.com/","United Kingdom"

In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established.From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.      Sample processing and clinical data:  Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.    Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

"bbmri-eric:contactID:UK_GBR-1-54","QUOD - Quality in Organ Donation","","Organ donation and transplant saves thousands of lives a year and could be considered one of the greatest successes in modern medicine. However, over the past decade, there has been an ever increasing need for organs throughout the UK, far surpassing the supply. This is a pattern that is predicted to worsen over the next 10 years.    As many as one in three patients on the transplant waiting list will die or become too unwell to receive a transplant as a result of this disparity.     To address this problem, the transplant community have been turning to organs previously considered to be unsuitable for transplantation, including organs from extended criteria donors and non-heart beating donors. In order to do this, QUOD aims to facilitate research by collecting blood, urine and tissue samples of appropriately consented / authorised organ donors. Through this, it may be possible to determine pathways of injury and repair in organs and identify biomarkers which can be used to better predict the outcomes of transplantation.    QUOD is a nationwide programme encompassing all retrieval zones in the UK. These regions include:     •Birmingham / Cardiff  •Cambridge  •Edinburgh  •London Kings  •Manchester / Leeds  •Newcastle  •Oxford / Royal Free    The QUOD team has a wide range of personnel, including specialist nurses, transplant surgeons, academics, management teams and a variety of healthcare professionals.

This collection was first assembled in the early 1980s from centres across the UK and it consists of nearly 200 cases in total, more than 100 of which are from young people (<20 years old) with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. The samples were originally held in Glasgow but, upon his retirement in 2015, Professor Foulis transferred them to University of Exeter Medical School, where they are now retained. Examples of stained images from the cases have been scanned in digital format and are provided here for public viewing.    Study of these cases has been hugely influential in shaping our current understanding of the aetiology of type 1 diabetes. For example, it has revealed that hyper-expression of class I MHC antigens is likely to be critical to islet cell destruction and has also allowed the first detailed profiling of immune cells present within inflamed islets. Interrogation of the samples has also shown that enteroviral infection of beta cells could contribute to the development of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. Thus, although it is now more than 30 years since this collection was first compiled by Alan Foulis, it continues to represent an invaluable resource for research into the causes of type 1 diabetes and is likely to do so for many years to come.","http://foulis.vub.ac.be/","United Kingdom"

Samples can be stored in our refrigerators, ultralow freezers and liquid nitrogen tanks. This gives the possibility for storage of biomaterial in a wide range of temperatures.


The BioBank is an initiative of the University Hospital Maastricht (azM) The BioBank works in close cooperation with Maastro Clinic (radiotherapy institute Limburg) and since 2007 a collaboration was started with the Parelsnoer Institute.

In January 2005, the BioBank became a Central Research Facility (COV). Besides the storage of samples, the BioBank provides the service to carry out some standard procedures. The data of the BioBank is saved in a fully automatic web-based BioBank Information System (BIS), which was completely renewed in 2012. To ensure the safety of the biological collections, two emergency procedures are used: the Building Management System (in Dutch: GebouwBeheerSysteem G.B.S,) and the Temperature Registration System Xiltrix, IKS).).","http://www.biobank.nl/","Netherlands"

There is a long tradition in both research with long-term cohorts of specific patient groups and in population-based studies. Well-known Groningen Biobank/cohort studies are LifeLines, Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen, PREVEND, GIANTT and TRAILS. Clinical biobanks have been given a boost by the participation of the UMCG in the Parelsnoer Institute (PSI) of the NFU.

Besides the different biobanks with large numbers of stored biomaterials and data, also a lot of expertise and experience  is available in the UMCG on all methodological aspects of biobank research (e.g. research design, bioinformatics, bio-imaging, laboratory processes, statistics, on legal and regulatory affairs and on quality and privacy). In addition, the UMCG invested in facilities for biobank research, especially large-scale ICT facilities and long-term storage of biomaterials. In November 2012, the Board established the UMCG Biobank Regulations, that provide rules and guidelines for the collection, storage and use of human tissue and associated data from patients in the UMCG.

UMCG researchers are active on important positions in all national research data / biobank organisations, such as the nationwide Parelsnoer Institute (PSI),  BBMRI-NL, NFU research IT ""data4lifesciences"" , ZonMw data management projects, Dutch Tech Centre for Life Sciences (DTL), Surf Sara projects. Also in Europe, various UMCG researchers have influential positions in the field of biobank research as in the large FP7 biobank projects: BioSHaRE, coordinated by the UMCG and  BBMRI LPC , with the UMCG as national representative. In addition, the UMCG  is closely involved in Elixir, the European bioinformatics consortium.","https://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/Researchers/Facilities/biobanks/biobanks/Paginas/default.aspx","Netherlands"

AMC Biobank scheme
The Biobank is part of AMC’s division G (Laboratory Specialisms) and works closely together with the Durrer Center for Cardiovascular Research, hosted by the ICIN–Netherlands Heart Institute. AMC Biobank and Durrer Center share people, rooms, protocols, and quality standards to facilitate high-quality sample/data collection and storage.
AMC Biobank currently houses more than 25 (biobank) studies, including various Parelsnoer collections, shared with other Dutch university medical centers, the HELIUS study on health differences among the residents of Amsterdam with different ethnic origin, and the MARS study on molecular diagnosis and risk stratification of sepsis.

The central mission of the ibdw is to support medical research for the benefit of patients/public health. Thus, co-operating and sharing resources with basic and clinical researchers are central tasks for the ibdw. These tasks are achieved by a strictly quality controlled collection and storage of human biological materials (since 08/2016 certified according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015), the structured acquisition of BM-related clinical core data, and by means of the Clinical Data Warehouse (Padawan/SAP HANA-MRI, which is also linked to the CCCM-cancer registry [ONKOSTAR]) access to all relevant BM-associated analytical (including molecular) and clinical (including therapeutic and imaging) data.","http://ibdw.ukw.de","Germany"

Die Patienten werden über 10 Jahre hinweg beobachtet, um Rückschlüsse auf den heterogenen Verlauf der Nierenerkrankungen und mögliche Komplikationen zu ermöglichen. Haupthypothese ist, dass sowohl mit Hypothesen-getriebenen als auch mit Hypothesen-freien Ansätzen mit Hilfe moderner Analysetechniken (z.B. Genomics, Proteomics) bislang nicht beschriebene Risikofaktoren und Marker identifizierbar sind, die mit der Progression von Nierenerkrankungen und kardiovaskulären Erkrankungen assoziiert sind und dass sich daraus neue diagnostische und therapeutische Ansatzpunkte ableiten lassen. 
Im zweijährigen Rhythmus werden Biomaterialien in einer zentralen Biobank gesammelt. Im Zwischenjahr finden Telefoninterviews statt. 
Im Bereich der Nierenerkrankungen ist die Anzahl der kontrollierten klinischen Studien wesentlich geringer als in anderen medizinischen Bereichen. Mit der GCKD-Studie soll die Basis für eine größere Zahl kontrollierter Studien gelegt werden. Letztendlich sollen durch gezieltere Diagnose- und Therapiemaßnahmen Prognose und Lebensqualität von Nierenpatienten verbessert werden.
Die GCKD-Studie ist konzipiert als weltweit größte CKD-Kohortenstudie und erste CKD-Kohortenstudie in Europa, die groß genug ist, um umfassende valide Assoziationen zwischen Biomarkern, Krankheitsprogression und Komplikation darzustellen.","https://www.gckd.de/","Germany"
