It functions as a service provider for the scientific and medical community as a whole. The Bank collects blood samples that originate from sample collection campaigns run by research teams, biologists and geneticists in France and abroad. The management and traceability of the samples (processing, storage, distribution and partnerships) are provided by the database known as 'Stocky' - specially developed at Genethon for the DNA Bank.The activities of the DNA and Cell Bank are as follows: oCollecting blood or DNA from patients affected with genetic diseases and their families with the minimum identification data necessary for the monitoring and follow-up of samples. oProcessing the samples in order to make them available to the scientific community and perpetuating DNA preservation (serum isolation and DNA extraction), isolating lymphocytes and establishing lymphoblastoid B lines and primary cultures (myoblasts and fibroblasts). oStoring samples for future research and preserving the genetic heritage by ensuring the long-term physical security of the preserved samples. oDistributing samples as necessary for ongoing research while complying with the principles and laws of bioethics and using the best available technologies at minimum cost. All these activities are carried out following Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) validated by the Quality Assurance department at Genethon.The Bank's activity is exclusively one of research, not of diagnosis.","http://www.genethon.fr/rd/banque-dadn-et-de-cellules/","FR"

The most frequently represented domains are Rheumatology, Oncology and Hepato-gastro-enterology.In the last five years, most of the collections have been in the constitution phase, not yet in the analytical phase. However, some collections have been analysed and the results seem interesting. This is the case for the following studies:-the FAKIR study promoted by the CHRU of Tours: Variability of the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics relationship of infliximab in rheumatoid polyarthritis : this study involved a clinical service (the Rheumatology service) and a research team (the GICC : Genetique Immunotherapie Chimie et Cancer)-the PEPIT study promoted by the CHRU of Tours : Study protocole of the passage of immunoglobulins transplacentally : this study involved a clinical service (the Rheumatology service) and a research team (the GICC)-the STORI study promoted by the GETAID (Groupe d'Etudes Therapeutiques des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif) : Prospective study of the predictive factors of remission maintenance in Crohn's disease after stopping the infliximab treatmentIn 2010, new clinical services have started to call upon the competencies of the CRB so we should be able to extend our scientific activity to the domains of Cardiology and Pneumology.","https://www.chu-tours.fr/presentation-du-crb-de-touraine.html","FR"

Using a biochemical assay with successive protein enrichment from frozen brain slices, we isolated ferritin light and heavy chains in a so far not known dominant autosomal disease. Our studies have provided additional knowledge and insights in the growing area of ferritin-related neurodegeneration disease. In the field of Creutzfeldt jakob disease, we provide an alternative biochemical definition of PrPSc diversity and new insights in the perception of Human TSE agents' variability. Different brain areas from 41 sCJD and 12 iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) cases (mainly from the Cerebrotheque de Toulouse) were investigated, using two new biochemical assays. We developed several clinical research projects on Alzheimer disease regarding different points: - Anti-amyloid-beta immunization. Besides descrpition of neuropathological lesions, we contributed to a work concluding on the impact of amyloid clearance restablishment on neurite curvature. These data agree with preclinical animal studies and demonstrate that vaccination does not merely clear amyloid from the Alzheimer's disease brain, but reduces some of the neuronal alterations that characterize Alzheimer's disease.- Sphingoloipid molecules implicated in apoptosis. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) has a critical role in regulation of survival of neurons. A previous work on culture cells in our research team (INSERM U858), showed that in vitro, neuronal loss was induced by ?-amyloid peptide 25-35 and it was correlated with alteration of sphingolipid biostat. Our hypothesis is that SphK1 is differentially expressed in neurons regarding their location in the vicinity or far from amyloid deposits in the brain of patients affected with AD. In an on-going national clinical research project (directed by Pr MB Delisle), our general objective is to precise on human brain material, the role of SphK1 in relation to neuronal loss and ?-amyloid location.","http://www.chu-toulouse.fr/catalogue-du-crb-tbr","FR"

The aim of the Henri Mondor Biobank is 1) to organize the reception, transformation, management and track of each biological sample issued from clinic research trials or patients care in order to constitute high quality and scientifically valuable collections of biological samples; 2) to guarantee a quality process as well as good laboratory practice in accordance with written and validated procedures and 3) to verify and apply the ethical and official regulations for protection of patients involved in biomedical and clinical research investigations. The Henri Mondor biobank is using a database software system (Biobase) for the management of the biological samples. To date, the numerous samples stored in the Plateform mostly concern rare diseases (neurofibromatosis, sickle cell disease, neuromuscular disorders) and cancer (uro-genital tumors, lymphomas, digestive cancers). This plateform is integrated into the clinical research activity of our institution and has strong relationships with the Clinical Investigation Center. Importantly, this biobank is in direct relationship with all the institutional research laboratories, mainly INSERM located within the hospital and Creteil Medical School.

This study identified N-Cadherin as a prognostic marker in superficial Urothelial tumours (Lascombe I, 2006).c)Twist is considered as a transcription factor that regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) by at least inhibition of E-Cadherin expression. Our results demonstrated its involvement in progression and matastasis devlopement by the inverse relationship with the E-cadherin expression (Wallerand H, 2009). d)Our aim is to study N-Cadherine and A-FABP (Fatty acid Binding Protein) by IHC  on superficial bladder  urothelial carcinoma. In our hypothesis a group of aggressive tumours N-cadherin positive and A-FABP negative could be detected. In this group on the fresh frozen specimen, mARN N-cadherin positive and A-FABP could be evaluated. 2)COLORECTAL CARCINOMASignal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3) has been implicated as an oncogene in several neoplastic diseases.

Patients will have a defined, actionable mutation responding to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and 3 or fewer sites of oligoprogressive disease, which will have developed after becoming resistant to targeted TKI treatment. 110 patients will be randomised to phase II of HALT with participants allocated to receive Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT;73 patients) or not (37 patients). All patients will continue TKI therapy.    The phase II study aims to evaluate if the addition of SBRT to treat limited (≤ 3) sites of oligoprogressive disease with continuation of current TKI therapy improves progression-free survival outcomes in patients compared with continuation of TKI alone.    The focus of the translational research will be on identifying clinically translatable biomarkers to identify patients who are likely to benefit from SBRT versus patients where transition to the next line of systemic therapy would be appropriate.","https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/our-research-centres/clinical-trials-and-statistics-unit/clinical-trials/HALT","UK"

There is a long tradition in both research with long-term cohorts of specific patient groups and in population-based studies. Well-known Groningen Biobank/cohort studies are LifeLines, Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen, PREVEND, GIANTT and TRAILS. Clinical biobanks have been given a boost by the participation of the UMCG in the Parelsnoer Institute (PSI) of the NFU.

Besides the different biobanks with large numbers of stored biomaterials and data, also a lot of expertise and experience  is available in the UMCG on all methodological aspects of biobank research (e.g. research design, bioinformatics, bio-imaging, laboratory processes, statistics, on legal and regulatory affairs and on quality and privacy). In addition, the UMCG invested in facilities for biobank research, especially large-scale ICT facilities and long-term storage of biomaterials. In November 2012, the Board established the UMCG Biobank Regulations, that provide rules and guidelines for the collection, storage and use of human tissue and associated data from patients in the UMCG.

UMCG researchers are active on important positions in all national research data / biobank organisations, such as the nationwide Parelsnoer Institute (PSI),  BBMRI-NL, NFU research IT ""data4lifesciences"" , ZonMw data management projects, Dutch Tech Centre for Life Sciences (DTL), Surf Sara projects. Also in Europe, various UMCG researchers have influential positions in the field of biobank research as in the large FP7 biobank projects: BioSHaRE, coordinated by the UMCG and  BBMRI LPC , with the UMCG as national representative. In addition, the UMCG  is closely involved in Elixir, the European bioinformatics consortium.","https://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/Researchers/Facilities/biobanks/biobanks/Paginas/default.aspx","NL"

The birth cohort is further split into two sub-groups, postnatal and antenatal, allocation to these groups is determined by the time of recruitment.  Recruitment to the two cohorts is currently ongoing across the UK.  A large amount of phenotypic and environmental exposure data is being collected via questionnaires and record linkage. A data dictionary, available on the study website, contains details of all the available data.      As a minimum, biological mother and affected child are recruited to the study.  Where possible, biological father or mother’s partner is also recruited.  In addition, the study aims to recruit unaffected and affected siblings for a small proportion of the cohort.      Biological samples are collected from all participants.  Parents and siblings of both cohorts and affected children of the 5-year-old cohort provide saliva samples.  Residual tissue and blood samples are collected from affected children recruited to the birth cohort.

Additionally participants can consent for spare blood, left after routine venepuncture to be stored for future research studies.  This has been implemented in tayside and Grampian with over 50,000 blood samples  intercepted by March 2017.    Anyone over the age of 11 years in Scotland can participate.  Participants are approached through a range of methods including directly at out-patient clinics and GP practices, leaflets with hospital letters and personal email from employers.   SHARE has recruited around 150,000 people, with over 95% of all individuals providing consent for the use of spare blood.  SHARE has demonstrated that it can quickly and efficiently recruit to studies. In addition it can be used to administer questionnaire studies by email and recruit to patient and public involvement groups.  SHARE continues to steadily recruit with the ambition of eventually achieving 1,000,000 people in Scotland. We are steadily extending the datasets we use for identifying participants. We are adding a mobile APP which will facilitate dissemination about research and allow the collection of physiological and activity data if desired. We anticipate SHARE will soon become the main source of health research recruitment in Scotland.    Cohort description paper: PMID: 28148535","http://www.registerforshare.org/index.php","UK"

All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases. Available comprehensive electronic health record linkage of the cohort’s participants (including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); ONS (Cancer registry, Death Certificates); National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN); and Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) allows exploiting clinical phenotyping and diseases diagnoses made during routine healthcare in the NHS. Women were also sent postal questionnaires. Secondary studies have to date generated additional data on symptoms, menopause and its management and further details of individual cancers.     The biobank contains >540,000 high-quality serum samples (10 x 500μL aliquots in straws), composed of baseline (from >189,000 women) and a unique longitudinal set of >350,000 annual serial samples (median 9) (from approximately 50,200 women).

This was achieved by establishing a biorepository and clinical research database. The biorepository is housed in the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, directed by Dr John McLauchlan and managed by Dr Sarah McDonald. Samples have been obtained from around 10,000 patients.    Access to samples and data is governed by a Tissue and Data Access Committee (TDAC). These are reviewed for ethical and scientific merit by TDAC and a decision reached.     Serum and plasma are obtained from all patients in the cohort. Buffy coats are also collected, and DNA can be extracted when required. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PAXgene tubes are held for smaller cohorts of patients. The extensive clinical data collected complements the biorepository and allows selection of samples from patients with characteristics of interest.    Sub-cohorts:  • Serial samples from patients who were treated as part of the NHS England Early Access Program.  • Yearly samples from cirrhotic patients (beginning 2015)  • Spontaneous resolvers  • Small paediatric cohort    Clinical Data  • Basic demographics incl place of birth and ethnicity  • History of HCV infection including exposure to risk factors and dates  • Date of diagnosis, date of first attendance at clinic  • Co-morbidites and co-medications at time of enrolment  • Liver disease status and how diagnosed  • Treatment status at enrolment;   • Social history including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis; BMI  • HCV RNA status, viral load and genotype/subtype  • Historical data from the patients' notes regarding previous treatment episodes (dates, regimen, viral loads, outcome) and liver biopsies  • Laboratory data including imaging and fibroscan;  • New treatment episodes and changes in liver disease status are recorded over time, as are any newly developed co-morbidities.    All data generated by researchers who access our biorepository must be returned into the database. Over time this will include host genetics, full length viral sequences, immunophenotyping and biomarker studies.","http://www.hcvresearchuk.org/","UK"

The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.    A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.    Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.    The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality    The WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.","http://walescancerbank.com/","UK"

Die Patienten werden über 10 Jahre hinweg beobachtet, um Rückschlüsse auf den heterogenen Verlauf der Nierenerkrankungen und mögliche Komplikationen zu ermöglichen. Haupthypothese ist, dass sowohl mit Hypothesen-getriebenen als auch mit Hypothesen-freien Ansätzen mit Hilfe moderner Analysetechniken (z.B. Genomics, Proteomics) bislang nicht beschriebene Risikofaktoren und Marker identifizierbar sind, die mit der Progression von Nierenerkrankungen und kardiovaskulären Erkrankungen assoziiert sind und dass sich daraus neue diagnostische und therapeutische Ansatzpunkte ableiten lassen. 
Im zweijährigen Rhythmus werden Biomaterialien in einer zentralen Biobank gesammelt. Im Zwischenjahr finden Telefoninterviews statt. 
Im Bereich der Nierenerkrankungen ist die Anzahl der kontrollierten klinischen Studien wesentlich geringer als in anderen medizinischen Bereichen. Mit der GCKD-Studie soll die Basis für eine größere Zahl kontrollierter Studien gelegt werden. Letztendlich sollen durch gezieltere Diagnose- und Therapiemaßnahmen Prognose und Lebensqualität von Nierenpatienten verbessert werden.
Die GCKD-Studie ist konzipiert als weltweit größte CKD-Kohortenstudie und erste CKD-Kohortenstudie in Europa, die groß genug ist, um umfassende valide Assoziationen zwischen Biomarkern, Krankheitsprogression und Komplikation darzustellen.","https://www.gckd.de/","DE"

LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.    The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 yeasr later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).      Current situation:  The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established.From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.      Sample processing and clinical data:  Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.    Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

However, over the past decade, there has been an ever increasing need for organs throughout the UK, far surpassing the supply. This is a pattern that is predicted to worsen over the next 10 years.    As many as one in three patients on the transplant waiting list will die or become too unwell to receive a transplant as a result of this disparity.     To address this problem, the transplant community have been turning to organs previously considered to be unsuitable for transplantation, including organs from extended criteria donors and non-heart beating donors. In order to do this, QUOD aims to facilitate research by collecting blood, urine and tissue samples of appropriately consented / authorised organ donors. Through this, it may be possible to determine pathways of injury and repair in organs and identify biomarkers which can be used to better predict the outcomes of transplantation.    QUOD is a nationwide programme encompassing all retrieval zones in the UK. These regions include:     •Birmingham / Cardiff  •Cambridge  •Edinburgh  •London Kings  •Manchester / Leeds  •Newcastle  •Oxford / Royal Free    The QUOD team has a wide range of personnel, including specialist nurses, transplant surgeons, academics, management teams and a variety of healthcare professionals.

Samples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful.   Although the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission.

"bbmri-eric:contactID:UK_GBR-1-31","Exeter Archival Diabetes Biobank","","During his career as a pathologist working in Scotland, Professor Alan Foulis compiled the world’s largest collection of autopsy pancreas samples recovered from patients who died shortly after receiving a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. This collection was first assembled in the early 1980s from centres across the UK and it consists of nearly 200 cases in total, more than 100 of which are from young people (<20 years old) with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. The samples were originally held in Glasgow but, upon his retirement in 2015, Professor Foulis transferred them to University of Exeter Medical School, where they are now retained. Examples of stained images from the cases have been scanned in digital format and are provided here for public viewing.    Study of these cases has been hugely influential in shaping our current understanding of the aetiology of type 1 diabetes. For example, it has revealed that hyper-expression of class I MHC antigens is likely to be critical to islet cell destruction and has also allowed the first detailed profiling of immune cells present within inflamed islets. Interrogation of the samples has also shown that enteroviral infection of beta cells could contribute to the development of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. Thus, although it is now more than 30 years since this collection was first compiled by Alan Foulis, it continues to represent an invaluable resource for research into the causes of type 1 diabetes and is likely to do so for many years to come.","http://foulis.vub.ac.be/","UK"

The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant.    The Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).      Sample collections:  Over the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:    • 847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples   • 514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine  • 706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)  • 149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine     All samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases.     Initially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.

In immunocompetent patients, atypical strains such as those found in French Guiana are associated with severe forms of acquired toxoplasmosis, whereas in immunodeficient patients, there was no significant difference in the clinical manifestations and the outcome according to the genotype, showing the overwhelming role played by immune status in this opportunistic parasite. Database on congenital toxoplasmosis showed that atypical genotypes were more frequently associated with severe forms after late maternal infection.

The main scientific project of our CRB was based on the approach genotype-intermediate phenotype related to CVD. Beyond the STANISLAS Cohort, this latest integrated other populations and particularly, a population of hypertensive patients. Actually, always in the same direction, we are interested in an integrative approach which takes into consideration: 1) the different metabolic pathways involved in the CVD, 2) a great number of information on genetics, mRNA and circulating proteins and 3) the intermediate phenotypes in the plasma/serum as well as in the PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) (bank of RNA and protein extracts of PBMCs in the 3rd recruitment of the STANISLAS Cohort, during 2003-2005). In 2008, we associated to this strategy which was essentially focused on the candidate-gene approach, the pangenomic approach. This approach, which enables revealing new loci related to disease, opened new perspectives to our CRB. First, a collaboration with a multi-centric character, with aim to detect new genetic loci in Europeans, which gave new exciting scientific results and enriched our CRB (we regrouped genotyping, phenotypic data and/or biological samples). Second, the European project BioIntelligence, supported by the Agency of Innovation in Industry and the EC. This latest, targets pharmacogenomics. At last, the collaboration with the prestigious Framingham cohort demonstrates the quality of our CRB and strengthens our international network. During these 4 years, we produced more than 40 original articles, and have been part of the National Network of Biobanks, the European Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI) and we are an IBISA platform.

"bbmri-eric:ID:FR_BB-0033-00050","CRB institutionnel Centre Leon Berard","CRB-CLB","The identification of key events during tumor development has led to innovative therapeutic approaches targeting critical defective pathways (hence the notion of ""targeted therapy""). However, the exclusive targeting of mitogenic mechanisms has shown two crucial limitations: the emergence of chemo-resistance within target cells and evasion promoted by tumor heterogeneity. In this context, the researchers and clinicians involved in this project share the will to focus their studies on intrinsic and extrinsic determinants that allow pre-cancer and cancer cells to escape from onco-suppressive barriers (apoptosis, senescence, interactions with the immune system and the microenvironment), with the aim to develop innovative therapeutic approaches designed to specifically target cancerous cell survival processes. The foundations of this project can thus be found in the scientific links that have been forged over the past few years between the diverse INSERM and CNRS units present on the site (INSERM Unit 590, UMR CNRS 5238, UMR CNRS 5201, INSERM Unit 865, and INSERM Unit 871), in the framework of this restricted but promising aspect of cancer research. Hence, above and beyond cancer research that unifies the different groups, the members of these various laboratories have expressed the will to define and develop common priority research themes:-The study of mechanisms of tumoral escape. The aim of this research axis, within the framework of specific tumor types (breast cancers, intestinal tumors, pancreatic tumors, virally-induced hepatic tumors, sarcomas, neuroblastomas, hematological malignancies), is to identify the mechanisms that allow cancerous cells to evade the intrinsic safeguard responses of the cell. It comprises three sub-themes with numerous interrelations both in conceptual terms and in terms of applied research:osub-theme 1 is the characterization of mechanisms allowing cancers to avoid intrinsic onco suppressive processes (senescence and apoptosis);osub theme 2 is the analysis of mechanisms of avoiding immuno surveillance;osub-theme 3 is the pre-clinical evaluation that the re-engagement of these safeguard mechanisms can be promising therapeutic approaches. The long-term objective is to improve understanding of the involvement of these mechanisms in the processes of tumor progression, metastasis and chemo-resistance, so as to be able to propose innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring these safety systems and identifying new diagnostic and predictive factors. -Analysis of the perversion of information flow by the carcinogenic process. In multi-cellular organisms, the continuous integration of signals from the microenvironment by normal cells requires the onset of specific genetic programs which express information stored in the hereditary material and, through transcription and translation, transfer this information to the effector molecules. At each step, major and multiple differences between normal and cancer cells are evidenced. The objective of this research theme is the identification of those differences that may be instrumental in determining the phenotypic divergence between normal and malignant states. These programs are recognized as being innovative and involving collaboration between groups. As such they form part of the priority research approaches cancer cluster CLARA (Canceropole Lyon-Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne). The approach ""Tumoral Escape"" forms the core of the research program of the Fondation de Cooperation Scientifique ""Synergie Lyon Cancer"" (Scientific Cooperation Foundation ""Lyon Cancer Synergy"") created in 2007 following the nationwide call for proposals from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, in order to create the Reseau Thematique de Recherche et de Soins (RTRS) (Thematic Network Research and Care). Furthermore, the work on the role of immunosurveillance as well as the analysis of virally induced cancers are developed within the framework of the scientific priorities of the Fondation ""Innovations en Infectiologie"" (FINOVI) and the Lyon Biopole, thereby creating close links between research themes of the sites of Lyon-Est and Lyon Sud-Gerland.","http://www.centreleonberard.fr/827-Les-plateformes-de-recherche-de-transfert.clb.aspx?language=fr-FR","FR"

In search for new molecules that induce PCD via caspase-independent PCD targets and that could open the way to novel therapeutic strategies in CLL treatment, we focused on CD47. This protein is a widely expressed member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, functioning both as a receptor for thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and as a ligand for the transmembrane signal regulatory proteins SIRP? and ?.

However, their quality and the particular viruses collected usually reflect the interest of the laboratory.  Moreover, when laboratories are re-organized, closed down or the virologist leaves or retires, many of these collections are lost to science. The European Virus Archive (EVA) was conceived as a direct response to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organizations and industry, initially within Europe but ultimately throughout the World.  In preparing the FP7 proposal, it was emphasized that it would be impossible to generate a wide ranging viral archive in a single laboratory complex. Thus, the ""virology club tradition"" was retained by developing an integrated infrastructure via consortia, operating through validated networks. Initially, 9 laboratories within the EU were directly associated to compose the core of the network.  EVA provides access to viruses through European laboratories by integrating their collections and devising validated protocols and effective dissemination procedures, the partner laboratories work to identical high standards in producing and supplying authenticated viruses to the scientific community globally. This has been obtained through intense exchanges of know-how consisting of workshops, trainings and staff exchanges. The current EVA organization is satisfactorily operating: about 1000 products have been distributed worldwide. Ultimately, the EVA network should generate the largest collection of animal and plant viruses in Europe and ultimately in the world and should move beyond the current state-of-the-art to provide a valuable resource and service. To reach its objective to become the key provider of virus and viral derived products worldwide, EVA expands its network at the European level but also outside Europe.","http://www.european-virus-archive.com","FR"

"bbmri-eric:ID:FR_BB-0033-00073","Goelamstheque CHU Cochin","GOELAMStheque","Scientific activity (2008-2010)The biobanque Goelamstheque has been created in 2008 by the French Multicenter Group, Groupe Ouest Est des Leucemies et Autres Maladies du Sang (GOELAMS), which comprises 39 hematology departments scattered in France and taking care of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). When the patients are included in various chemotherapy trials initiated by the GOELAMS, samples of bone marrow and blood before treatment are sent to the Goelamstheque in Hopital Cochin. Similarly, in the trials when it is required, patient samples are timely sent to the biobanque according to the protocol to perform biological studies, including the measurement of minimal residual disease. Following specific applications and approval by the GOELAMS scientific committee, many research projects have been conducted using samples frozen in the Goelamstheque.  These projects aimed to characterize the leukemic stem cells, to analyze the signalling pathways dysregulated in blast cells and thereby to identify some specific targets for new therapies in AML.The research group led by Dr P. Mayeux and Dr D. Bouscary (Paris, Cochin) studied protein synthesis and showed  an mTORC1-independent deregulation of oncogenic protein synthesis in human myeloid leukemogenesis. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway has tumor suppressor activity in acute myeloid leukemia through the repression of mTOR-dependent oncogenic mRNA translation.A work in collaboration between Dr C. Recher (Toulouse) and Dr V. Bardet (Paris, Cochin) allowed the characterization of the leukemic stem cells in the population of the CD34+ CD38- CD123+ phenotype. They determined the prognostic value of the percentage of blasts within this phenotype and showed that overall, the percentage of CD34+ CD38- CD123+ leukemic cells at diagnosis significantly correlated with response to treatment and survival. In addition, Dr Patrick Mayeux and Dr Valerie BARDET belong to a large French network aiming at the characterization of leukemic stem cells (""reseau de cellules souches cancereuses"") directed by Pr. Christine CHOMIENNE, hospital St Louis, Paris.","/","FR"

They all require a large number of patients in order to have a sufficient power to detect associations between genetic variations and phenotypes. All these studies require biological sampling allowing DNA extraction for high throughput genotyping and sequencing.As a prerequisite, the biological samples stored and informations need to be reliable. Thus quality requirements are our constant concern since the creation of the LAG-CRB.The growing number of samples to manage (more than 215 000 samples July 1st, 2010) reinforces the setting up of a quality management system (on the basis of the standart NF S 96-900) to maintain the satisfaction of our partners and the recognition of our services by the researchers and the institutions.","http://www.pasteur-lille.fr","FR"

As such, it endorses 2 main transversal activities open to the scientific community working on infectious diseases and immunity :oa clinical investigation activity, which ensures accurate recruitment and follow-up of well-characterized volunteers - healthy or patients -, participating to research protocols,oa biobank activity, which allows all human samples to be collected, then prepared, preserved, and distributed following the best standards of quality. The quality process led to ISO 9001v:2000 certification of the biobank activity in 2007 and NF-S96-900 in 2009.Recently, new protocols started in 3 main fields : ? diagnosis of infectious diseases : -ICAReB manages WHO's biobank of Human African Trypanosomiasis, to promote new performing, cost-effective and simple diagnostic methods of this disease ;-The ""DIAGMICOLL"" cohort, allows through a wide range of samples, the setting up and validation of new diagnostic methods in the field of infectious and tropical diseases.? knowledge of different pathologies with infectious expression : -The Hidrosadenitis suppurativa (Verneuil's disease) project, adresses the genetic bases of this disease, -The Pathodisc protocol has been conceived to screen the samples of patients who present with infectious syndrome without by new high-throughput methods, so as to find out the causative agent.-Mucolfa project proposes to search for the agent(s) causing anosmia in a proportion of patients, after iterative viral attacks.? validation of the methods of preparation and preservation of the bio-resources.This has started with a project with BRCs from the French Network, to optimise the pre-analytical quality of different sort of samples on proteomic criteria (serum, buffy coats...).
