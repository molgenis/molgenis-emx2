Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Dolichocephaly is distinct from Prominent occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately. Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped)."

The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW).

On hematoxylin and eosin stain, amyloid is identified as extracellular amorphous material that is lightly eosinophilic. These deposits often stain weakly for periodic acid Schiff (PAS), demonstrate a blue-to-gray hue on the trichrome stain and are typically negative on the Jones methenamine silver (JMS) stain. These tinctorial properties contrast with the histologic appearance of collagen, a major component of basement membranes, mesangial matrix and areas of sclerosis, which demonstrates strong positivity for PAS and JMS (See Figure 1 of PMID:25852856).|In the kidney, amyloid deposits may be found in any of the parenchymal compartments, including glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and/or vessels. Glomeruli are most commonly involved. In most instances, amyloid accumulation involves the mesangium before the capillary walls. In early cases, the process can be subtle and involves only a few mesangial regions and therefore can easily be missed by routine histologic evaluation. More extensive involvement results in marked expansion of the mesangium, which can take on a nodular appearance and mimic mesangial sclerotic processes such as diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

Postural instability,Postural instability,HPO,HP_0002172,"A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps.

Edema canbe observed in and around regions of dead or dying brain, around metastases and abscesses, after traumatic injury, following hypoxic ischemic injury, and around primary brain tumors. There are at least five different types of edema: vasogenic, cytotoxic, hydrostatic, interstitial, and hypoosmotic. Three effects of edema are visible on imaging: (i) loss of gray-white matter differentiation; (ii) swelling of sulci (shrinking of gyri); and (iii) mass effects. On CT scanning, extensive low density may represent vasogenic edema. As the brain swells, not only do the sulci decrease, but all of the CSF spaces of the hemispheres (including the ventricles) decrease as well. Magnetic resonance tomography may show abnormalities of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Phenotype terms involving cerebral edema thus reflect inference about the underlying processes responsible for these abnormalities on brain imaging."

Waddling gait,Waddling gait,HPO,HP_0002515,"Weakness of the hip girdle and upper thigh muscles, for instance in myopathies, leads to an instability of the pelvis on standing and walking. If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck."

Type IV atherosclerotic lesion,Type IV atherosclerotic lesion,HPO,HP_0002635,"In type IV atherosclerotic lesions a dense accumulation of extracellular lipid occupies an extensive but well-defined region of the intima. This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion."

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience."

Immature B lymphocytes rearrange their immunoglobulin-gene variable segments (V segments), diversity segments (D segments) and joining segments (J segments), producing a functionally integrated VDJ segment linked to the mu constant region (C-mu), which determines the primary antibody repertoire composed of IgM antibodies. The second step is antigen- and T-cell-dependent and takes place in secondary lymphoid organs. After encountering antigen, B cells proliferate and form germinal centers. In this unique anatomic formation, two genetic events lead to generation of the secondary antibody repertoire: class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR of immunoglobulins occurs by a recombination process between two different switch regions (S regions) located upstream of each C region.

MGT. The rods are delicate and accumulate subsarcolemmaly. They stain negative with ATPase, NADH and SDH as they lack myosin and mitochondria. Rods are characteristic of nemaline myopathy but also seen in central core disease and various other diseases which include neurogenic disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, undefined), inflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, periarteritis nodosa), metabolic myopathy (mitochondrial myopathy), muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and some undefined myopathies (Liouet al; Diagnostic role of nemaline rod in neuromuscular disease.

This assessment relies on the judgment of the examiner to recognize when the difference between the expected and the observed is significant. The affected digits should be specified. The definition does not mandate the component of the increased size (bone, connective tissue, etc.), but should exclude edema. The requirement that the girth is most, or all, of the digit is intended to distinguish this from broad fingertips. This should be distinguished from Broad fingers or Broad fingertips as the girth is circumferential in macrodactyly, which is not the case for broad fingers or broad fingertips, which are increased only (or predominantly) in their lateral (A/P) width."

Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers.|Normal human muscle is composed of many individual muscle fibers bundled together by layers of connective tissue that are arranged in a nesting-doll like fashion. The inner most structure, the single muscle fiber, is covered by a thin layer of primarily reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium is quite inconspicuous and muscle fibers appear to be in direct contact with each other. The finest capillaries, nerve twigs and lymphatic capillaries are found within the endomysium. Groups of muscle fibers are bound together by the thicker perimysium, forming structures called fascicles. Capillaries, nerve fibers and lymphatic vessels also track in the perimyseum. Bundles of fascicles are encased within the dense irregular connective tissue of the epimysium. These connective tissue layers provide mechanical protection for the muscle fibers and increase the tensile strength of the muscle. The layers are continuous with the tendon, which provides attachment to bone. Individual muscle fibers are syncytia, formed by embryonic fusion of many myoblasts or later, myosatellite cells. Each muscle fiber contains many nuclei, peripherally positioned immediately adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane. In healthy muscle only 3-5 percent of fibers contain nuclei that are located internally, within the cell, but many disease processes lead to internal nuclei. Each nucleus provides a segment of the cell with needed translated protein products."

Here, the name 'Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis' is preferred to emphasize that the term refers to a phenotypic feature rather than a disease entity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may result in pain in the hip, limp, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and some degree of atrophy of the affected leg. The phrase Legg Perthes syndrome or Legg Calve Perthes disease is also used to refer to a number of diseases, including the idiopathic form and a form that is related to mutation in the COL2A1 gene (MIM 150600). Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 to 10 years old, and is clinically characterized by limping, hip stiffness, limited range of motion, and can result in restriction of growth of the affected leg and wasting of the muscles of the upper thigh."

Delayed patellar ossification,Delayed patellar ossification,HPO,HP_0006454,"Formation of bone in the patella later than normal.|The patella initially ossifies at between three and five years, commencing as multiple foci that rapidly coalesce. As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers. These are most common superolaterally and may lead to the development of a bipartite patella. The bipartite patella has cartilaginous continuity despite the appearance of osseous discontinuity. The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years). Accordingly, typical measurements such as medial and lateral angulation cannot be accurately done prior to the final stages of patellar ossification expansion and maturation (PMID:6729496)."

They are defined as the time (seconds) needed to clot platelet-poor plasma upon addition of coagulation triggers, such as tissue factor in complex with phospholipids and calcium chloride (in the PT), or negatively charged phospholipids-activators and calcium chloride (in the APTT). They can hence be considered as global coagulation tests sensitive to deficiencies of many coagulation factors. In brief, they are both sensitive to factor X, V, II and fibrinogen, whereas the PT is only sensitive to factor VII deficiency and the APTT is sensitive to pre-kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), factor XII, XI, IX and VIII deficiencies. Normal plasma in the PT clots approximately within 10-12 s upon triggering coagulation, and the normal reference range is (usually) narrow. PT results have been reported as clotting time, percentage activity, PT-ratio (patient-to-normal clotting time) and as international normalized ratio (INR). The INR scale has been devised to harmonize results stemming from different thromboplastins from patients on treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Some recommend abandoning the approach of using percentage activity to assess PR."

VWF serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII), and also facilitates platelet adhesion through its interaction with platelet GPIb on the platelet surface and through its binding to the subendothelial matrix. This interaction is driven in vivo by shear stress, which induces a conformational change in VWF that allows it to bind platelet GPIb. In vitro, however, this interaction is induced by the antibiotic ristocetin, which enables VWF and platelet GPIb to interact in the absence of shear forces. Laboratory testing of VWF utilizes ristocetin in the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which is a measure of VWF binding to platelets, or by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA)."

Usually, pulsatile tinnitus is heard as a lower pitched thumping or booming, a rougher blowing sound which is coincidental with respiration, or as a clicking, higher pitched rhythmic sensation. Pulsatile tinnitus may be associated with vascular abnormalities such as arterioevenous shunts or glomus tumors or the jugular vein, arterial bruits related to a high-riding carotid artery (close to the auditory areas) or carotid stenosis, or venous abnormalities such as a dehiscent jugular bulb or to hypertension. Finally, in some patients, mechanical abnormalities such a spatulous eustachian tubes, palatomyoclonus (small spasms of muscles in the soft palate area), or idiopathic stapedial muscle spasm may represent the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus."

The axis can lie within a normally formed or partially duplicated digit resembling a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe, or hallux. Alternatively, the axis can be in an interdigital space with a flanking pair of digits that resemble a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe or hallux. The most lateral digits on each side of the hand typically resemble fifth fingers/toes.|Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA."

Intramembranous ossification refers to the direct replacement of primitive mesenchyme with bone, and is responsible for bones such as the calvarium (e.g., frontals, parietals, interparietal) and the clavicula. In endochondral ossification, the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate, which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification, including those at the base of the skull, the vertebral column, pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age.

This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [PMID:15210614]."

Podocyte hypertrophy,Podocyte hypertrophy,HPO,HP_0020133,"Increase in size of the podocytes of the renal glomerulus.|Podocytes, also called visceral glomerular epithelial cells, are terminally differentiated cells that line the outer surface of the glomerular basement membrane. Podocytes prevent protein leakage into the urinary space, and also provide important tensile strength to the glomerular capillaries, by opposing the hydrostatic pressure from within. In contrast to glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells, podocytes do not typically proliferate. Studies have shown that following podocyte loss, the inability of podocytes to proliferate contributes to the development of glomerulosclerosis. Consequently, in order to cover the denuded glomerular basement membrane, podocytes increase in size due to hypertrophy. Although this is initially compensatory, podocyte hypertrophy is likely maladaptive, and contributes to glomerulosclerosis."

Increased total iron binding capacity,Increased total iron binding capacity,HPO,HP_0025196,"An elevation in the total-iron binding capacity, which measures how much serum iron is bound if an excess of radioactive iron is added. A high TIBC corresponds to a high transferrin concentration. The latent (or free) iron binding capacity is the difference between the TIBC and the measured serum iron, corresponding to the transferrin not bound to iron, i.e., free iron binding capacity.|Iron is transported to body tissues by a protein, transferrin, in plasma. This protein has two high-affinity binding sites for iron. Determination of total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) of the plasma therefore gives a measure of transferrin, although it can also be directly determined. Virtually all plasma iron (P1) normally is bound to transferrin, and measurement of P1 is assumed to reflect the amount of transferrin iron. The expression transferrin saturation, expressed as percent [(P1/TIBC) x 100], indicates the availability of iron to tissues. As transferrin saturation increases, there is an increase in the amount of diferric transferrin, which has a greater capacity to deliver iron than does monoferric transferrin. Measurements of P1, TIBC, and transferrin saturation have served several purposes in clinical medicine. The P1 concentration and (particularly) transferrin saturation relect the adequacy of iron supply. A saturation of less than 16% indicates a deficient iron supply, whereas a saturation of over 60% as measured on more than one occasion represents excessive iron loading owing to increased iron absorption or liver disease. An increased transferrmn concentration as reflected in the TIBC indicates iron depletion if the effects of estrogen and pregnancyare excluded. Other characteristic changes inboth P1 and TIBC are useful in the differential diagnosis of various diseases, for example, the decrease in transferrin saturations associated with a decreased transferrin concentration in inflammatory states."

They have a central role in innate immunity and they regulate adaptive immunity. In healthy individuals, circulating neutrophils are freely flowing in a resting, dormant state. Upon infection, neutrophils are the first circulating cells to arrive at the infection and inflammatory site. Phagocytosis triggers the activation program of the neutrophils, leading to the intraphagosomal release of antibacterial peptides, proteases, myeloperoxidase, and superoxide anion (O2-), which is produced via the activation of the NADPH oxidase. Superoxide anion is the initiating spark leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxylradical and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), all contributing to the death and destruction of the bacteria within the phagosome. ROS production by the phagocytes was first referred as the respiratory burst or oxidative burst due to the rapid and cyanide-insensitive increase in oxygen uptake, increase in glucose consumption, andimmediate ROS release. The enzyme system dedicated to superoxide anion production, i.e., the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a member of the NOX family of proteins also referred as NOX2, is composed of six proteins, two trans-membrane proteins (p22phox and gp91phox) that form theflavocytochrome b558, and four soluble proteins (p47phox,p67phox, and p40phox and the small G-proteins, Rac1/2)."

The term FPE designates the loss of the usual interdigitating pattern of foot processes of neighboring podocytes, leading to relatively broad expanses of podocyte processes covering the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). It is widely viewed as a pathological derangement that is associated with leakage of macromolecules such as albumin through the glomerular filtration barrier.|Two stages of podocyte foot process effacement (FPE) may clearly be distinguished. Within the first stage, foot processes undergo tremendous changes in shape, losing their regular interdigitating pattern and retracting into short irregularly shaped cell projections. Slit diaphragms are lost or displaced from their usual position at the base and replaced by occludens-type junctions between the deformed, broadened foot processes.

Tessier number 1 facial cleft,Tessier number 1 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031572,"As seen in a typical cleft lip, a cleft of the lip is found in the region of the cupid's bow. The nostril is cleft through the alar dome and extends above onto the nasal dorsum. It passes medial to a normal, but dys- topic, medial canthus. There is an alveolar cleft between the central and lateral incisors that extends above through the pyriform margin lateral to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is not involved. The bony cleft extends through the nasal bone or between the junction of the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. Above the cleft lip, the clefting of the alar dome is associated with deviation to the opposite side of the shortened and broadened columella and nasal tip. Extension of the soft tissue cleft onto the nasal dorsum can be manifest as a series of vertical soft tissue furrows and ridges. Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions. There is a keel-shaped alveolus and anterior open bite. Normal septation is preserved between the nasal cavity and the hypoplastic maxillary antrum on the affected side. Distortion of the nasal skeleton produces gross flattening of the nasal dorsum. There is asymmetry of the pterygoid plates, of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid, and of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. The distortion of the cranial base may result in a mild plagiocephaly."
Tessier number 2 facial cleft,Tessier number 2 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031573,"As is typically seen in isolated cleft cases, a cleft of the lip is present. There is hypoplasia, but not true notching of the ala nasi with flattening of the lateral part of the nose. The nasal root is broadened, with lateral displacement of the inner canthus. The palpebral fissure and lacrimal drainage system are not disturbed. The alveolar cleft is through the lateral incisor area and extends to the pyriform aperture. There is normal septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Notching at the junction between the nasal bone is present, as is a broad, flat frontal process of the maxilla. Transverse ethmoid enlargement produces orbital hypertelorism. Above the cleft of the lip and palate is a true broad cleft of the nostril that is medial to the intact, but laterally displaced, tail of the alar cartilage. A shallow soft tissue groove extends superiorly to the asymmetrically widened nasal root. The lacrimal system, palpebral fissures, and eyebrows remain intact. The alveolar cleft extends posteriorly as a complete unilateral cleft of the hard and soft palate. The nasal septum is intact but deviated to the opposite side. The nasal cavity remains separated from the normally pneumatized, although hypoplastic, maxilla on the cleft side. Above the nasomaxillary notching, the ethmoid sinus is less well developed, and there is no pneumatization of the frontal sinus on this side. Anterior rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid occurs on the cleft side in relation to the narrower orbit and smaller ethmoid sinus. There is mild asymmetry of the anterior cranial fossa, which is narrower on the cleft side. The cranium is brachycephalic with marked occipital flattening."
Orbital cleft,Orbital cleft,HPO,HP_0031574,A facial cleft characterized by involvement of the orbit.
Tessier number 3 facial cleft,Tessier number 3 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031575,"As in the Number 1 and Number 2 clefts, this cleft extends through the lip in the region of the typical cleft lip; however, it does not extend through the base. The cleft continues superiorly to involve the inner canthus and lower eyelid medial to the inferior lacrimal punctum, thereby disrupting the nasolacrimal system. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side. The pterygoid process appears anatomically normal, but less displaced from the midline compared with that of the noncleft side. Both the orbit and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa are inferiorly displaced."
Tessier number 4 facial cleft,Tessier number 4 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031576,"The cleft lip is midway between the philtral ridge and the commissure of the mouth. The cleft is lateral to the normally shaped and placed nasal ala and passes onto the cheek. The cleft extends through the lower eyelid lateral to the punctum. The lacrimal system and inner canthus are normal. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The orbital floor cleft has no communication with the inferior orbital fissure. The cleft does not extend to the skull base, but there is marked facial asymmetry associated with plagiocephaly."
Tessier number 5 facial cleft,Tessier number 5 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031577,"The cleft of the lip is just medial to the oral commissure and extends across the cheek as a furrow. It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium."
Tessier number 6 facial cleft,Tessier number 6 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031578,"A facial cleft extending from the zygomatic arch to the eye. This zygomaticomaxillary cleft is similar to that typically found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The overlying tissue shows a vertical sclerodermic furrow radiating from the labial commissure or the angle of the mandible across the cheek to a coloboma of the lower eyelid between the middle and lateral one-third. Microphthalmia is not observed. The skeletal cleft is between the maxilla and zygoma; it passes through the inferolateral orbital rim to enter the inferior orbital fissure. No alveolar cleft is present. The zygomatic arch is intact. The soft tissue furrow, which is more apparent on the right, radiates from the oral commissure toward the lateral two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The antimongoloid obliquity of the palpebral fissures is associated with laterally placed lower eyelid clefts and some ectropion. A left-sided anophthalmia is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue hypoplasia and is reflected in a short palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and minor ptosis of the eyebrow. No abnormality is present in the alveolar arch except for some tilting of the occlusal plane secondary to hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla. There is a vertical bony groove in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture that ends in the inferolateral portion of a small bony orbit. More laterally, the remainder of the zygomatic body and arch is normal in both shape and dimension. The lateral orbital floor is downslanting but intact, and it lacks direct communication with the temporal or infratemporal fossae. The hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla and orbit is associated with a reduction in the transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the anterior cranial fossa; mild asymmetry of the middle cranial fossa and calvarium is present. No significant asymmetry of size, shape, or position is present in the sphenoid."
Tessier number 7 facial cleft,Tessier number 7 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031579,"The temporozygomatic Number 7 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia. Soft tissue manifestations include macrostomia, malformations of the external and middle ear, temporalis muscle, variable involvement of the seventh cranial nerve (in hemifacial microsomia), and abnormalities of the preauricular hair in Treacher Collins syndrome. The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric. There is no antegonial notching of the mandible. Marked cranial base asymmetry, with tilting and asymmetric positioning of the temporomandibular articulations, is present. The anatomy of the sphenoid is abnormal, especially on the right where there is no recognizable medial or lateral pterygoid plate."
Tessier number 8 facial cleft,Tessier number 8 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031580,"The frontozygomatic or Number 8 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and the Goldenhar variant of hemifacial microsomia. Skeletal defects are more prominent in Treacher Collins syndrome, whereas the soft tissue clefting is more typical in cases of ''Goldenhar syndrome''. Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The symmetry of the facial anomalies is reflected in the apparently normal symmetric anterior and middle cranial fossae."
Tessier number 9 facial cleft,Tessier number 9 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031581,"This is an upper lateral orbital cleft. The soft tissue deformity is in the lateral one-third of the upper eyelid, and the bony cleft is through the superolateral orbital angle. Microphthalmia is present. The superolateral bony deficiency of the orbits allows a lateral displacement of the globes. The lateral one-third of the upper eyelid and the outer canthus are distorted, thus preventing apposition to the globe. The upper eyelid does not have a true cleft. A soft tissue furrow radiates superiorly and posterisphenoid is symmetric and normal. Mild cranial base asymmetry is reflected in the pterygoid plates. The left pair is more laterally displaced from the midline. Skull vault plagiocephaly is evident with an apparent reduction in the anteroposterior dimension of the anterior cranial fossa."
Tessier number 10 facial cleft,Tessier number 10 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031582,"In a Number 10 Tessier cleft there is an upper central orbital cleft with a cleft of the middle one-third of the upper eyelid, which often results in total ablepharia. The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated. Similar distortion of the anterior cranial fossa is evident, being broader and more flattened on the affected side. The calvarium above the level of the cleft and the cranial base below is symmetric."
Tessier number 11 facial cleft,Tessier number 11 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031583,"An upper medial orbital cleft produces a cleft of the medial one-third of the upper eyelid that extends through the eyebrow into the frontal hairline. The skeletal element of the cleft in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla may either pass lateral to the ethmoid, through the supraorbital rim, or it may pass through the ethmoidal labyrinth to produce orbital hypertelorism. This cleft usually accompanies the Number 3 cleft. The soft tissue features include a cleft of the medial portion of the upper eyelid, an irregularity in hair orientation at the medial end of the eyebrow, and a long tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline onto the forehead. There is a mild flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla and extensive pneumatization of both the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses, both of which are more prominent on the cleft side. No bony clefting of the supraorbital rim or frontal bone is evident. The cranial base and sphenoid architecture, including the pterygoid processes, are symmetric and normal."
Tessier number 12 facial cleft,Tessier number 12 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031584,"There is a soft tissue cleft medial to the inner canthus with a cleft of the root of the eyebrow. The frontal process of the maxilla is flat and broadened, and the ethmoid labyrinth is increased in tranverse dimension, thereby producing orbital hypertelorism. The cribriform plate is of normal width. The frontal sinus is enlarged. Even though the frontal bone is flattened, bony clefts with encephalocele have not been observed. There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse. The extensive pneumatization of the sinuses on the cleft side extends backward through the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and into the sphenoid sinus. The anatomy of the sphenoid, including the pterygoid processes, is otherwise normal. The anterior and middle cranial fossae floors are both broadened on the cleft side with minor widening of the cribriform plate."
Tessier number 13 facial cleft,Tessier number 13 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031585,"There is a paramedian frontal encephalocele and a soft tissue cleft that passes medial to an intact eyebrow. The frontal bone shows a paramedian bony cleft with an associated encephalocele. The olfactory groove, cribriform plate, and ethmoid sinus are all increased in transverse diameter, resulting in hypertelorism. The cleft extends medially to the undisturbed eyebrow to end in a short paramedian frontal widow's peak. The bony cleft begins in the region of the nasal bone and extends superiorly through the full height of the frontal bone. Posteriorly, the cleft extends through the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus as far as the lesser wing and body of the sphenoid. The pterygoid processes are anatomically normal, but they are displaced laterally from the midline on the cleft side. There is orbital hypertelorism below and asymmetry of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa above."
Tessier number 14 facial cleft,Tessier number 14 facial cleft,HPO,HP_0031586,"This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa. The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is upslanting from its medial aspect to its lateral aspect, with a harlequin appearance on the coronal scan."

Complicating features may arise because of individual differences in risk factors and tissue reactions. These may include differences in composition of the blood, the relative quantities and distributions in the components of the underlying lesion or intima, as well as modifications of shear and tensile forces to which the lesion or intima is exposed. Clinical imaging of lesions may be expected to contribute greatly to the understanding of type VI lesions and the associated clinical syndromes.|Morbidity and mortality from atherosclerosis is largely due to type IV and type V lesions in which disruptions of the lesion surface, hematoma or hemorrhage, and thrombotic deposits have developed. Type IV or V lesions with one or more of these additional features are classified as type VI and may also be referred to as complicated lesions. Type VI may be subdivided by the superimposed features. Thus, disruption of the surface may be labeled type VIa; hematoma or hemorrhage, type VIb; and thrombosis, type VIc.

Also, some early investigators argued about the definition of a central lumen, choosing pseudo to indicate that the hub was not a true lumen but contained structures. Nevertheless, this pattern remains extremely diagnostically useful and the modifier unnecessarily leads to confusion. Perivascular pseudorosettes are encountered in most ependymomas regardless of grade or variant."
Neurocytic rosette,Neurocytic rosette,HPO,HP_0031930,"A type of rosette that is similar to the Homer Wright rosette, but the central fiber-rich neuropil island is larger and more irregular.|Pineocytomas and central neurocytomas represent well-differentiated neuronal neoplasms with small rounded nuclei, analogous to those normally encountered in the internal granular layer of the cerebellum or the dentate fascia of the hippocampus.

Neurogenic claudication,Neurogenic claudication,HPO,HP_0031952,"Lumbar spinal stenoses may induce symptoms following an individually typical latency on standing or when walking due to swelling of the cauda equina, which leads to compression. This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down. Activities performed in a flexed posture, such as cycling often cause less problems than walking. For the same reason, walking uphill may be tolerated better than walking downhill.

Dystonic gait,Dystonic gait,HPO,HP_0031954,"Dystonic gait disorders frequently appear bizarre, particularly because activity increases dystonic tonus and posture. The abnormal posture of the foot in dystonic gait typically involves inversion, plantar flexion and tonic extension of the big toe. In many patients complex types of walking, such as walking backwards and running are paradoxically less impaired than walking forward and may seem completely unaffected. Sensory tricks, for instance, if the affected individual rests a hand on his or her neck, may improve or even normalize dystonic gait in some patients."

This term describes the elastic network as being thinned at each lamella with narrower and more frayed apart elastic fibers. This entity may be associated with an increase in extracellular matrix material in the lamellar unit. The use of an elastic stain is essential to identify this lesion."
Aortic elastic fiber disorganization,Aortic elastic fiber disorganization,HPO,HP_0032085,"Nonparallel arrangement/disarray of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.|This rarer process is distinct from fragmentation and loss as the fibers acquire a more haphazard, poorly organized appearance, with loss of the usual parallel/concentric arrangement of elastic fibers within the lamellar unit. This finding is noticeable when at high power, and the orientation of the lamellar units parallel to the aortic lumen is lost. The use of an elastic stain is essential to identify this lesion. Disorganization of elastic fibers can be seen in conjunction with smooth muscle cell disorganization. A poorly oriented aortic specimen may appear to have disorganization and should not be confused with the real entity. This rarer entity should be commented upon, when present as it represents a more severe feature of medial degeneration, but is not essential for routine surgical pathology reporting."

While the loss of a nucleus suggests the loss of the entire cell, this is not easily appreciated on an hematoxylin and eosin stain stain. The shorter term smooth muscle cell loss was also considered by the consensus group and had many proponents, but the addition of nuclei was ultimately favored by the majority mostly as a histologic definition. Smooth muscle cell nuclei can be lost in patches or can be lost in a band-like pattern. This lesion can be noted in the absence of laminar medial collapse, described below. Both stains highlighting collagen and SMA immunohistochemistry can be used to highlight smooth muscle cell changes."

Epithelial cells are shed regularly and replaced by stem cell sources located at the limbus, a rim of tissue located at the junction of the cornea and sclera. The limbal epithelial stem cells reside in specific regions at the limbus known as the limbal stem cell niches. Damage to the stem cells or disruption of the niches may lead to Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency. In the absence of a healthy corneal epithelium, the conjunctiva proliferates over the cornea resulting in opacification and vascularization, which in turn may lead to reduced vision, pain, and photophobia."

The infection is caused by a member of the Poxviridae family, the molluscum contagiosum virus. Molluscum contagiosum presents as single or multiple small white or flesh-colored papules that typically have a central umbilication. The central umbilication may be difficult to observe in young children and, instead, may bear an appearance similar to an acneiform eruption. The lesions vary in size (from 1 mm to 1 cm in diameter) and are painless, although a subset of patients report pruritus in the area of infection. On average, 11-20 papules appear on the body during the course of infection and generally remains a self-limiting disease. However, in immunosuppressed patients, molluscum contagiosum can be a severe infection with hundreds of lesions developing on the body. Extensive eruption is indicative of an advanced immunodeficiency state."

Certain individuals are able to mount an effective immunoglobulin G response against C. difficile toxin A. This humoral immune response against the C. difficile toxin is believed to allow an individual to become an asymptomatic carrier. In contrast, people who fail to mount an immune response to C. difficile toxin are susceptible to infection. In general, patients on immunosuppressive therapy have a blunted ability to mount immune responses and, therefore, may be at greater risk for infection."

Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia,Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia,HPO,HP_0032202,"Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is widely accepted as the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). VSCC arises via either a human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated pathway, or more commonly, via a mechanism independent of HPV, often being linked to chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (LS). Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS. As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC."

Not surprisingly, their classification has attracted much attention, and a numbers of schemes have been described. The cornerstone of the granulomatous response, however, is the predominant involvement of mononuclear phagocytes. As granulomas develop, tissue-resident, as well as inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes become intimately acquainted, and these cells may develop highly differentiated epithelioid cell characteristics. In many cases, elegant multinucleate populations can be seen, distinct from the syncytia formed after viral infection as evident by their extended life-span. Accumulating lymphocytes, mainly T cells, contribute to the developing microarchitecture of the granuloma, often with characteristic patterns of subset organization relative to the core of mononuclear phagocytes and to each other. B lymphocytes, plasma cells, NK cells and neutrophils may all be present, though a relative paucity of neutrophils delineates these sites of inflammation from those associated with necrosis. At its extreme, the granuloma may serve as the focus for irreversible fibrotic reactions, but, even in less dramatic cases, a substantive degree of local tissue remodelling occurs."
Eosinophilic granuloma,Eosinophilic granuloma,HPO,HP_0032253,"A type of granuloma characterized morphologically by the predominance of Langerhans cells with characteristic grooved, folded, indented nuclei in the appropriate milieu that includes variable numbers of eosinophils and histiocytes including multinucleated forms, often appearing similar to osteoclasts or touton like giant cells, neutrophils and small lymphocytes. The concentration of the eosinophilic infiltrate varies from scattered mature cells to sheet-like masses of cells. Occasionally, areas of bone necrosis may interrupt the cellular infiltrate. The foamy cells may also be amassed in clumps, which are of no clinical significance because these clumps represent phagocytosis of lipid debris.|Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a benign disorder that affects children and young adults, particularly males. Solitary EG accounts for the majority of  Langerhans cell histiocytosis cases, usually involving bone and less commonly the lymph nodes, lung or skin."

The sign, seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan images, suggests dural sinovenous thrombosis. It is best seen on wider window settings. It is a reliable sign of sinus thrombosis but is seen only in 25-30% of these cases.|The use of multislice contrast-enhanced CT scan, with reconstructions into thinner slices in different planes, markedly improves the yield. The sign may not be seen in the early stage (less than 5 days) of thrombosis, as the fresh clot is hyperdense, or in the late stage (after more than 2 months), as numerous channels of recanalization develop in the thrombus after 2 months."
Dural tail sign,Dural tail sign,HPO,HP_0032268,"This sign represents thickening and enhancement of the dura mater in continuity with a mass, which on MR images, gives the appearance of a tail arising from the mass. The dural tail is thought to represent reactive change; however, it may also be due to tumor invasion. Three criteria need to be met for a positive dural tail sign: the tail should be seen on two successive images through the tumor, it should taper away from the tumor, and it must enhance more than the tumor.|This sign has been traditionally considered as highly specific for meningioma.

It has a strong association with spina bifida and is very useful for detecting this condition before 24 weeks of gestation in high-risk patients. It has high sensitivity and specificity. The lemon sign may disappear as gestational age advances and hence it is less reliable after 24 weeks. The sign is not specific for spina bifida and has also been seen in encephalocele, Dandy-Walker malformation with encephalocele, thanatophoric dysplasia, cystic hygroma, diaphragmatic hernia, corpus callosal agenesis, hydronephrosis, and umbilical vein varix."

It is seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI images, in optic nerve sheath meningioma. The sign helps distinguish between optic nerve sheath meningioma and optic glioma. Optic glioma arises from glial cells within the optic nerve and there is no clear separation between the nerve and the tumor; hence the tram-track sign is not seen in optic gliomas. Calcification may be seen in optic nerve sheath meningiomas in 20-50% of cases and hence the tram-track sign may be seen on nonenhanced CT scan images as a linear calcification around the nerve, but this is less common."

It can be divided into 3 sections including the amino terminus of the PCT region, immature calcitonin, and calcitonin carboxyl-terminus peptide-1 (CCP-1). Procalcitonin is encoded by CALC-1 gene located on chromosome 11. Cleavage in 1 site of the primary transcript of CALC-1 gene produces pre-PCT, which further undergoes proteolytic cleavage of its signal sequence to produce PCT. The synthesized PCT then undergoes post-translational processing to produce small peptides and mature CT. PCT is a biomarker that exhibits greater specificity than other proinflammatory markers (eg, cytokines) in identifying patients with sepsis and can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections. The short half-life (25-30 hours in plasma) of PCT, coupled with its virtual absence in health and specificity for bacterial infections, gives it a clear advantage over the other markers of bacterial infection."

This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels)."

Recurrent singultus,Recurrent singultus,HPO,HP_0100247,"A contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating a hic sound. Also known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, from the Latin singult, the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc.|A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves."
Hemiballismus,Hemiballismus,HPO,HP_0100248,"Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that is caused primarily by damage to various areas in the basal ganglia. Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements.|Hemiballismus is a very rare movement disorder. It is five hundred times rarer than Parkinson disease. Its effects can sometimes be severe enough to prevent patients from being able to perform daily functions. It is usually associated with structural brain lesions but can occur with metabolic abnormalities. The symptoms can also decrease while the patient is asleep, unlike some movement disorders. Ballism refers to very large-amplitude choreic movements of the proximal parts of the limbs, causing flinging and flailing limb movements. Ballism is most frequently unilateral, in which case it is referred to as hemiballism"

From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic."

Cerebral visual impairment,Cerebral visual impairment,HPO,HP_0100704,"A form of loss of vision caused by damage to the visual cortex rather than a defect in the eye.|The term cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) was coined to describe damage to visual pathways and structures occurring during early perinatal development. The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric populations of non-ocular cause, and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However, as further characterization of this condition progressed, it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including subcortical structures, white matter pathways, as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus, the word cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer, and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature, the HPO will regard these terms as synonymous. It is recommended that more specific terms be used as appropriate for annotation."

During gestational weeks 4 to 7, the primary palate originates from the median palatine process, which itself originated from frontonasal prominence. The lip, alveolus, and hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen all share this origin in development. During this period, disruptions of palatal development process can result in primary palate clefting. The secondary palate develops from the lateral palatine processes originating from the maxillary prominences between 7 and 12 weeks, and the hard palate posterior to incisive foramen and the soft palate are developmental products of this process. As such, disruptions during this time will result in secondary palate clefts.
