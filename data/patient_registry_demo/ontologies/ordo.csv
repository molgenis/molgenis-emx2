Larger deletions including bands 5q35.1, 5q35.2 and 5q35.3 cause a more severe phenotype that associates severe developmental delay with microcephaly, and significant cardiac defects (e.g. atrial septal defect with/without atrioventricular conduction defects, Ebstein anomaly, tetralogy of Fallot) linked to haploinsufficiency of <i>NKX2.5</i> (5q35.1).

,3188,Congenital pulmonary veins atresia or stenosis,,,3188,http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_3188,"A rare progressive and life-threatening anomaly of the great vessels characterized by narrowing and obstruction of one or more normally positioned pulmonary vein at their junction with the left atrium. Presentation is typically during early infancy with dyspnea, tachypnea, and repeated pulmonary infections. Eventually, when all pulmonary veins of one lung are affected, the disorder results in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and consecutive pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It may manifest as an isolated lesion or associated with other cardiac defects such as congenital pulmonary venous return anomaly and septal defects."

The obstruction at the valvular level can be associated with obstruction at the subpulmonary, or supravalvar levels (valvar, subpulmonary, supravalvar pulmonary stenosis (PS)."

Patients frequently present late, after schooling has started, with non-progressive, conductive hearing loss often associated with speech delay and poor school performance."
,99880,Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome,,,99880,http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_99880,"A rare genetic disease characterized by synchronous or metachronous occurrence of primary hyperparathyroidism and ossifying fibroma of the maxilla and/or mandible, associated with an increased risk of parathyroid carcinoma. Occurrence of renal cysts or tumors, multiple uterine polyps, and thyroid tumors has also been reported."
