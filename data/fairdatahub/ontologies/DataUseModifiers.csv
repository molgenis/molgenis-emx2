"research with individual-level linkage prohibited","This requirement indicates that use of the data is limited to studies in which different data types about the same individual from different datasets are not combined. Linking data is usually used to compile epidemiological data, leading to a richer dataset. The logic of record linkage is that two or more items of information about a person recorded at different times, and perhaps in different places, may be of greater value when considered together than when either is considered alone. The potential risk is that the data subjects in the dataset become more identifiable.","NCIT","C15424","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C15424"
