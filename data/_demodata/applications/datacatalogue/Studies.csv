Immune-Image_WP6,,,WP6: Trials with immunotracers in patients with cancer and inflammatory diseases,,,,,,"To confirm safety of new immunotracers and to demonstrate their clinical utility in combination with anatomic imaging (MRI or CT) for patients with cancer and IMID. Clinical application of the novel immunotracers will focus on diagnostics and patient stratification based on immune status as well as prediction of response or long-term outcome of therapeutic interventions, early detection of immune system activation, target engagement within the tissue of interest, both systemically and locally. The trials described below in cancer and IMID patients are envisaged in the first 2 years of Immune-Image, until newly developed tracers become available. The PET studies will be performed in conjunction with WP2 to allow technical validation of simplified procedures and image analysis methods that are suitable for multi-centre trials. Harmonization of PET/CT system performance and imaging methodology across sites will be performed prior to the start of clinical studies (WP2). We will apply MRI radiomics techniques for detecting immune cell infiltration, where we will employ texture analyses of multi-parametric MR images to detect the subtle changes in MRI-detected tissue architecture that accompany immune cell infiltration.  

Common for all clinical trials proposed The first smart small clinical trials will be performed at 2-4 fully equipped consortium partners to clinically test existing immunotracers and, as next steps, new immunotracers developed in WP3-5 will be included. All required regulatory documentation will be written and processed with the relevant authorities. Special attention will be paid to national differences in regulatory affairs. The trials will be multi-centre studies including 2-4 centres with expertise in the required fields. Patients and patient advocates will be involved in protocol writing, including patient information forms. They will be updated on progress, and will provide feedback during Immune-Image. The trials will have a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and will be monitored. Data will be stored and analysed as described in WP2. Major effort will be put into harmonization of procedures and SOPs will be put in place. Immune-Image partners have experience in performing multi-centre PET studies. Targeted tissue biopsies will be performed to relate imaging findings with tissue analyses, comprising IHC, RNA analyses and, when applicable, circulating tumour DNA. High dimensional, multi-parametric immunoprofiling will be performed, as in WP4 and WP5. RNA-seq profiles will serve to generate gene expression-based immunological parameters, utilizing computational deconvolution methods, specifying the type, fraction or functionality of immune cells in tissue samples. The consortium has extensive experience in correlating parameters with image features, disease outcome and treatment response. Moreover, access to large biobanks such as N-CIA and POINTING, which will soon comprise deep immunephenotyping of > 3,000 patients with various tumours, will allow us to compare tissue results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immune-Image_Task_6.2a,Immune-Image_Task_6.2b,Immune-Image_Task_6.3,Immune-Image_Task_6.1,Immune-Image_Task_6.5,Immune-Image_Task_6.6,Immune-Image_Task_6.8,Immune-Image_Task_6.7,Immune-Image_Task_6.4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immune-Image_WP4,,,WP4: Immune cell imaging technique development and tracer validation,,,,,,"The objective of WP4 is to characterise in a preclinical setting newly developed immunotracers from WP3, as described in Table 2, to provide proof-of-concept data in small animals before further validation, including therapeutic interventions, in advanced disease-specific animal models and in non-human primates in WP5 and ultimately translation towards clinical application (longitudinal monitoring of immunotherapy) in WP6. First, we will evaluate the in vivo distribution and pharmacokinetics of the immunotracers developed in the project in WT, immune-deficient (ID), KO or, when cross-reactivity is not achievable, KI mice - where the (extracellular part of the) murine target is replaced by that of the human target protein via methods such as CRISPR/CAS. As imaging modalities, we will apply PET/MRI, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, MRI or OI (Task 4.1-2). Immunotracers with unsuitable pharmacokinetics and/or biodistribution will be returned to WP3 for kinetic immunotracer modelling and further optimisation (Figure 2). Ex vivo immunohistochemistry, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis for cross-validation of in vivo PET or OI data will be employed. Next, chronic, cutaneous, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (DTHR, driven by CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes where the effector phase is associated with the homing of macrophages, B-lymphocytes and neutrophils) in the right ear will be employed, which will allow us to visualise the cells of interest non-invasively in vivo with PET/MRI, PET/CT, OI and intravital two photon microscopy (2PM) (Table 3). This mouse model is specifically suitable for cross-validation of in vivo with ex vivo data sets (Task 4.3). Immunotracers which were successfully tested and validated in the cutaneous DTHR model will be further evaluated in immunogenic cancer models and IMIDs (Table 5), where a convolution of all immune cells of interest are involved, at the time point with strongest immune cell recruitment. This will enable us to establish optimised imaging protocols & workflows for WP5, which will focus on longitudinal cancer and IMIDs therapy monitoring studies, as well as the identification of immune therapy responders. WP4 will strongly interact with other WPs to advance new molecular imaging paradigms. Employing the immunotracers from WP3 and already available immunotracers WP4 (Table 2) we will: (1) determine the ideal set of multi-modality imaging tools for immune cell tracking in simplified pre-clinical models; (2) develop imaging protocols & workflows:
e.g. dosing, imaging time point, appropriate quantitative image reconstruction, correction and analysis; (3a) evaluate utility in the simplified experimental mouse model of chronic cutaneous DTHR for initial validation at the time point with strongest immune cell recruitment; (3b, gated on success of 3a) evaluate utility in immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy sensitive syngeneic tumours and in IMID models, including quantification of immune cells of interest into cancers, IMIDs, draining lymph nodes and spleen at the time point with strongest immune cell homing; (4) correlate and validate imaging data with ex vivo analysis such as biodistribution, autoradiography, immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immune-Image_Task_4.1,Immune-Image_Task_4.3,Immune-Image_Task_4.4,Immune-Image_Task_4.2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immune-Image_WP3,,,WP3: Generation of imaging reagents to uniquely identify specific cell types,,,,,,"The main objective of WP3 is to generate new tracers for crucial immunological players in cancer and IMIDs, as summarised in Table 2 and described above. These tracers will be developed by international specialists in the various research fields. As such, we aim to fulfil an unmet need by providing new tracers for molecular imaging. Tracers resulting from WP3 will be evaluated in WP4 and WP5. In addition to labelling small molecules and peptides, we will employ nanobody technology as the main platform for new tracer design. These antibody fragments have already shown benefit for precision imaging in cancer and IMIDs (Krasniqi A. et al., 2018; Chakravarty R., Goel S. and Cai W., 2014). It is crucial that the tracers have an excellent safety profile, display appropriate PK and biodistribution properties, and are inert with respect to the normal biological function of the targeted molecules. Nanobodies are perfectly suited for this since (1) monovalent nanobodies, in contrast to bivalent agents such as full antibodies or engineered minibodies, will not cross-link or activate the targeted receptors, and (2) nanobodies have a low immunogenicity profile. Therefore, the tracers should only marginally activate or de-activate signalling cascades as a consequence of binding cell surface markers, such as CD8. In addition, we will explore bi-specific nanobodies (CD8/CD69) to enhance specificity of the immunotracer signal for the subset of activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. As immune cell activation is likely to be linked to the biochemical/physical nature of the targeting vehicle and the targeted epitope, all nanobodies of interest will be screened early in in vitro immune cell activation tests to select a lead with the lowest likelihood of triggering toxicity in patients. We will also develop a novel in vitro cell labelling technique that will be applied to particular immune cell subsets that are the target of tracers being developed and validated in WP3 and WP4. As such, these cells can be tracked in vivo in mice, thereby providing a novel method to validate the in vivo signal of the newly developed cell-specific tracers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immune-Image_Task_3.3,Immune-Image_Task_3.6,Immune-Image_Task_3.5,Immune-Image_Task_3.1,Immune-Image_Task_3.4,Immune-Image_Task_3.2,Immune-Image_Task_3.8,Immune-Image_Task_3.7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
