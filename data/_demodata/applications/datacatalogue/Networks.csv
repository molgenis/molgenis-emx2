PCM4EU,,PCM4EU,Personalised Cancer Medicine for all EU citizens,EU4health - Diagnosis and Treatment,,https://www.matrix-fkb.no/en/pcm4eu/home,,,"With 3.7 million new cases each year, cancer is one of the leading causes of death and morbidity in the EU. Personalised cancer medicine (PCM) has the potential to beat this disease. But currently, there is inequality in access to PCM between and within EU Member States.

As PCM is based on targeting driver mutations in tumours, its success depends on access to:

next-generation sequencing-based molecular diagnostics,
clinical decision support systems,
trials to facilitate implementation of the PCM approach.

PCM4EU aims to improve the survival rates and quality of life of cancer patients in the EU using PCM based on best practices. The project consortium has a good track record in the implementation of molecular diagnostics in academically-led cross-border PCM trials in north-western Europe. This expertise will be made available to support a wider use and access to PCM in Europe.",,,,2023,2024,,,,,,,,

NEWROAD,,NEWROAD,Open Platform for European Networking and Repurposing of Oncological Assets and Drugs,EU4health - Diagnosis and Treatment,,https://new-road.eu/,,,"Despite advances in technology, the productivity of the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the efficacy of cancer drugs, appears to be faltering due to unsustainable long-term costs and timeframes. In response, NEWROAD seeks to streamline this process by developing an EU-wide capability for Systematic Drug Repurposing (SDR), particularly for cancer treatment.

NEWROAD will create an open, collaborative platform to repurpose drugs in oncology. The platform will be accessible via high-performance computers and the cloud, drawing upon data provided by healthcare institutions and pharmaceutical companies.

Objectives
NEWROAD's primary aims are to:

develop novel therapies based on drug repurposing;
facilitate sharing of clinical data among European Union entities;
create an open, collaborative platform for Systematic Drug Repurposing.

Approach
NEWROAD utilises an Augmented Intelligence (AuI)-based platform for collaborative development of therapies via drug repurposing. Additionally, the platform also acts as a protocol for sharing clinical data uploaded by hospitals, universities, and research organisations. This data sharing aspect not only enhances the Artificial Intelligence’s capabilities but also marks the most innovative aspect of the project.

The final component of the platform offers an integrated in silico function that allows users to analyse and repurpose existing drugs or proprietary compounds. This unique protocol evaluates all data related to the disease of interest and available pharmacopoeia, conducting in silico testing on a rationally selected panel of oncological targets.",,,,2022,2025,,,,,,,,

AACR GENIE,,AACR GENIE,AACR Project GENIE: Powering Precision Medicine,Data science,,https://www.aacr.org/professionals/research/aacr-project-genie/,,,"Precision medicine requires an end-to-end learning health care system, wherein the treatment decisions for patients are informed by the prior experiences of similar patients. Oncology is currently leading the way in precision medicine because the genomic and other molecular characteristics of patients and their tumors are routinely collected at scale. A major challenge to realizing the promise of precision medicine is that no single institution is able to sequence and treat sufficient numbers of patients to improve clinical-decision making independently. To overcome this challenge, the AACR launched Project GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange).  

AACR Project GENIE® is a publicly accessible cancer registry of real-world clinico-genomic data assembled through data sharing between 19 leading international cancer centers. Through the efforts of strategic partners Sage Bionetworks and cBioPortal, the registry aggregates, harmonizes, and links clinical-grade, next-generation cancer genomic sequencing data with clinical outcomes obtained during routine medical practice from nearly every cancer patient treated at these institutions. The consortium and its activities are driven by openness, transparency, and inclusion, ensuring that the project output remains accessible to the global cancer research community for the benefit of all. 

We see the GENIE data providing another knowledge turn in the virtuous cycle of research, accelerating the pace of drug discovery, improving clinical trial design, and ultimately benefiting cancer patients globally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

EuroClonality-NGS,,EuroClonality-NGS,EuroClonality-NGS Working Group,Research Group,,https://euroclonality.org/,,,"The main objectives of EuroClonality-NGS, being a scientifically independent Working Group, are to develop, standardize, and validate IG/TR NGS assays for clonality assessment, MRD analysis and repertoire analysis (see Workpackages page).
Assay development

Even though several of such assays have already been published, there is still place for further optimization in assay design and development with the aim of ensuring better coverage of all genes and also evaluating other types of rearrangements (partial IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements, IGK locus rearrangements including those involving the kappa-deleting element, IG and TR translocations, etc.).
Assay standardization

Irrespective whether existing or novel assays are employed, one of the most important aspects in the implementation of NGS in routine practice concerns standardization, which pertains not only to the analytical phase but also to the pre-analytical phase (e.g. sample preparation, choice of target) and the post-analytical phase (e.g. bioinformatics pipeline, clinical interpretation).
Assay validation

Finally, a very important aim of the EuroClonality-NGS Working Group is to validate the technology via large-scale, multi-laboratory testing of clinical samples and in the context of clinical trials. By using a similar approach as previously followed in the BIOMED-2/EuroClonality program, this should provide robust tools and methodology which will allow to exploit the full potential of this powerful new technology in clinical practice.
EuroClonality-NGS as generic model structure

The NGS technology has general requirements on standardization and clinical validation, irrespective whether it concerns the field of hematological malignancies, oncology, genetics, infectious diseases or any other area of medicine. Therefore, even though EuroClonality-NGS is focusing on IG/TR genes, it will strive to make the structure and overall scheme generic enough and available as a model for other consortia that aim to implement NGS technologies in routine clinical diagnostics in other fields of medicine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

BEACON,,BEACON,Cancer Care Beacon - Reducing Disparities Across the European Union,EU4health - Diagnosis and Treatment,,,,,"Disparities in cancer care have a big impact on survival rates, as well as on the quality of life and mental health of patients and their families.

Income, education, location and ethnicity are some of the most important factors affecting quality of care in Europe. Healthcare costs, treatment options, integration of research and innovation into care and access to information and multidisciplinary care teams are other areas to target in addressing disparities.

To facilitate delivery of higher-quality cancer care, BEACON aims to identify the reasons for and reduce disparities in care across Europe.

Specifically, it will:

map and increase the capacity and capabilities of cancer treatment centres in EU Member States;
help patients to find the best treatment options, healthcare providers to share resources and expertise, researchers to share data on disparities, and policymakers to align funding with patients' priorities;
improve training and ensure that accreditation of care providers reflects quality of care.",,,,2022,2024,,,,,,,,

Guide.MRD,,Guide.MRD,Guiding multi-modal therapies against MRD by liquid biopsies,RIA - Research and Innovation,,https://www.guidemrd-horizon.eu/,,,"Patients diagnosed with early-stage cancer frequently undergo surgery to remove the tumour. However, it is often hard to tell if the disease has already spread to other parts of the body, i.e. there is minimal residual disease (MRD). The challenge facing healthcare teams today is to determine which patients have MRD and so need additional treatment (such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy) to destroy any remaining cancer cells which may have escaped the surgeon’s scalpel, and which patients do not need further treatment. This is extremely important as many cancer treatments come with multiple side effects, so treating patients unnecessarily may cause more harm than good. At the same time, not treating patients who need it allows the cancer to reoccur and potentially spread.

Current imaging technologies are not sensitive enough to detect MRD, pointing to the need for more sensitive tests that are able to detect traces of cancer remaining in the body after surgery.

The GUIDE.MRD project aims to address this challenge by exploring how blood tests could be used to identify which patients might benefit from additional treatment, and which patients would likely not benefit from treatment. The project focuses on patients with lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.

Cancers usually shed small fragments of tumour DNA into the patient’s bloodstream, and these circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) fragments can be recognised and detected by blood tests. While tests to detect ctDNA in blood samples already exist, the level of ctDNA each test can detect varies from one test to another, and the key details of how these tests work are not publicly available. This makes it hard to gauge the accuracy of the tests; once we know that the details of a blood test are accurate, clinicians, regulators and patients will have confidence in the results and healthcare teams will be able to better integrate the blood tests into their clinical practice to improve patient care. 

GUIDE.MRD’s first step will be to define standards and use them to benchmark ctDNA tests available now. When ready, the standards will be made public so that they can be used widely. The project will rank existing blood tests according to how accurate they are at correctly identifying patients as either ctDNA positive or negative. The team will then use the most promising ctDNA blood tests in a clinical trial and compare the accuracy of the ctDNA blood tests against clinical outcomes to treatments. Finally, the most accurate ctDNA blood tests will be used as a tool to help doctors and patients select the right treatment for their individual situation.",,,,2023,2028,,,,,,,,

Survival and genetic diagnostics are crucial to find the right treatment for patients.

The previous NOPHO-DBH AML12 protocol showed that advanced diagnostics and evaluations are essential to improving treatment outcomes. However, access to cutting-edge treatments such as targeted therapies that address the genetic basis of cancer is not equally available across European countries. To address this, the CHIP-AML22 consortium aims to focus on three key areas.

Genetic profiling of leukemic cells to identify subgroups of patients with prognostic indicators, which can help improve risk-group stratification across the consortium.
Introducing tailored treatments based on gene activity information garnered from next-generation sequencing and transcriptome analysis of leukemic cells.
Implementing and evaluating advanced treatment-response evaluations to further improve treatment outcomes.

One such example of treatment-response evaluation is the use of minimal residual disease (MRD) measurements, which assess the frequency of residual leukemic cells at specific time points during and after treatment. The previous NOPHO-DBH AML12 protocol already incorporated MRD measurements in the evaluation process, and it contributed to the study's success. Further implementation and evaluation of MRD measurements using flow cytometry and molecular/genetic methods can be employed across the consortium to improve treatment outcomes.

In implementing these focus areas, the project aims to improve overall outcomes for all children with AML treated within the NOPHO-DB-SHIP consortium. Its findings can provide valuable insights for a broader cohort of patients, including those with adult AML.",,,,2022,2025,,,,,,,,

TAIPO,,TAIPO,Trustworthy AI tools for personalized oncology,ERC - Research,,,,,"Modern machine learning algorithms have the potential to accelerate personalized medicine in a fast pace. To date, first tasks in medicine are being addressed with machine learning algorithms that surpass humans in terms of accuracy and speed, including diagnosis, outcome prediction and treatment recommendation. However, for a widespread adoption in clinical practice, a good performance in terms of speed and accuracy is not sufficient: practitioners also need to be able to trust a model’s prediction in all stages of its life cycle.
I will facilitate an efficient interaction of clinicians with AI models by developing trustworthy AI tools for personalized oncology: First, I will develop trustworthy AI tools and algorithms for diagnosis and stratification of cancer patients. Second, I will establish a framework for reliable and transparent modelling of personalized outcomes and therapy decisions in oncology.
TAIPO will result in novel algorithms and software tools for quantifying and improving the trustworthiness of AI models that I will apply to three clinical applications: (i) trustworthy AI-based skin lesion classification based on dermoscopic images, (ii) stratification and personalized outcome modelling for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) based on omics data, and (iv) therapy recommendation for metastatic breast cancer patients based on electronic health records.
TAIPO will increase the throughput of trustworthy diagnoses of skin lesions and pave the way for low-cost access to diagnostic care. It will empower clinicians to make personalized and reliable therapy decisions, which we will demonstrate at the example of AML and metastatic breast cancer. Our novel algorithms to evaluate and improve the reliability of AI models are a crucial contribution to close the gap between in-silico AI-bench and bedside and will further push the field of trustworthy machine learning with many applications of AI in medicine.",,,,2023,2028,,,,,,,,
CANCER-RADIOMICS,,CANCER-RADIOMICS,Deep Learning for Automated Quantification of Radiographic Tumor Phenotypes,ERC - Research,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep-learning in particular, is propelling the field of radiology forward at a rapid pace. In oncology, AI can characterize the radiomic phenotype of the entire tumor and provide a non-invasive window into the internal growth patterns of a cancer lesion. This is especially important for patients treated with immunotherapy as, despite the remarkable success of these novel therapies, the clinical benefit remains limited to a subset. As immunotherapy is expensive and could bring unnecessary toxicity there is a direct need to identify beneficial patients, but this remains difficult in clinical practice today. Radiomic biomarkers could address this, as, unlike biopsies that only represent a sample within the tumor, radiomics can depict a full picture of each cancer lesion with a single non-invasive examination. Previous work found significant connections between radiomic data, molecular pathways, and clinical outcomes. However, a direct link between radiomics and immunotherapy response has not yet been established. This project will address this problem by analyzing unique multicentre clinical data, including non-invasive imaging, clinical outcomes, and extensive biologic characterization of patients with lung or melanoma cancer. Specifically, I will develop deep-learning radiomic biomarkers to predict immunotherapy response using baseline (WP1) and follow-up imaging (WP2). I will also investigate if radiomics can characterize underlying biological factors, and, in turn, can be used to improve response predictions (WP3). Successful completion of this proposal will demonstrate the potential of radiomics to help physicians in selecting patients who will likely benefit from immunotherapy, while sparing this expensive and potentially toxic treatment for patients who don't. This work has implications for the use of imaging-based biomarkers in the clinic, as they can be applied noninvasively, repeatedly, and at low additional cost.",,,,2020,2025,,,,,,,,

CPW,,CPW,Cancer Prevention at Work (CPW): Occupational health surveillance in the implementation of prevention of infection-related cancer.,RIA - Prevention and Early Detection,,,,,"Chronic infections represent a major cause of human cancer: on a global scale, they are responsible for an estimated 13% of human cancers. Helicobacter pylori (Hp), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) are responsible together for 75% of these cases, or 10% of total cancer burden [De Martel et al.,2020]. Occupation health surveillance is mandatory in all European countries: although the mechanisms of its implementation vary between the countries, these programs are in general aimed at diagnosing and preventing work-related diseases. Prevention of occupational cancers has therefore been a component of occupational health surveillance. In recent years, however, there has been a movement towards including in occupational health surveillance aspects of health promotion which are not occupational in a strict sense. This approach stems from several considerations: (i) the contact between the worker and the health professional in charge of the surveillance can be seen as a privileged opportunity for health promotion in general; (ii) through the worker, the health promotion initiative may reach other groups of the population; (iii) because of the periodic nature of the visits entailed by the occupational health surveillance, it is possible to efficiently implement follow-up mechanisms. The conceptual framework of the proposed research is based on the incorporation into on-going occupational surveillance schemes of primary prevention programs against infection with Hp, HCV and HPV. The overarching objectives of the proposed research are:
- to conduct a series of pilot projects aimed at assessing the effectiveness (including cost-effectiveness) of incorporating primary prevention interventions against Hp, HCV and HPV into existing occupational surveillance systems in high-risk populations, including its impact beyond the workers directly involved in the pilot projects;
- to identify barriers and bottlenecks for the implementation of such interventions.

DIOPTRA,,DIOPTRA,Early Dynamic Screening for Colorectal Cancer via Novel Protein Biomarkers Reflecting Biological Initiation Mechanisms,RIA - Prevention and Early Detection,,https://www.dioptra-project.eu/,,,"The EU-funded DIOPTRA project aims to introduce a front-line screening tool that will consider risk factors and protein biomarkers for pinpointing individuals at a high risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Tissue and blood samples will be examined for a discriminative set of prognostic proteins that are detectable via standard blood work and can indicate a need for further evaluation (i.e. colonoscopy). Other data (e.g. medical, behavioural) will also be considered as potential risk factors. AI will be leveraged for assessing prognostic power, while personalised behavioural changes will be promoted based on modifiable risk factors. Given the low citizen participation in CRC screening across the EU, DIOPTRA seeks to broaden the evaluated population, boosting participation rates and bypassing age screening thresholds.
DIOPTRA inspires to address the aforementioned issues by incorporating new technologies for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) risk assessment, screening and progression, while providing robust evidence-based indications of CUP relationships to CRC. We aim to build a strong evidence base toward a unified holistic protocol for primary CRC screening, applicable both to undiagnosed cancer patients (via scheduled screening recommendations) and CUP patients corresponding to the CRC phenotype. Toward this goal, we will incorporate lifestyle and environmental factors and gauge the predictive power of investigated biomarkers and gene-expression profiling, seeking to unveil molecular mechanisms of CRC development and CUP incidence.

GlycoMap,,GlycoMap,Integrated Glycomics for Cancer Precision Medicine,RIA - Diagnosis and treatment,,,,,"Breast Cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Europe and remains the first cause of cancer death in women (nearly 92,000 deaths in 2020). Precision medicine uses data-driven insights to reflect the heterogeneity of patients and improve cancer care by offering actionable oncology treatment options. Tumour tissue heterogeneity is the leading cause for inter-patient variation in treatment response. One of the largest sources of tissue heterogeneity arises from post-translational glycosylation of proteins and aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of breast and other cancers. Yet, substantial gaps remain in our knowledge of cancer glycans. Glycomics (the comprehensive study of the glycome) offers the potential to provide the global glycosylation status (GlycoMap) of a patient and shed new light on tumour heterogeneity to guide precision medicine. This project aims to address the substantial knowledge gap in breast cancer tumour glycosylation data by developing an integrated glycomics workflow to produce patient-specific 'GlycoMaps'. By including glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 'omics from intact GAGs for the first time, combined with other glycan analyses will enable the generation of Breast Cancer GlycoMaps from resistant and drug-sensitive patient-derived organoids (mini avatars of tumour tissue), defining residual tumour tissue following treatment that causes relapse and metastasis. The mission and design of the GlycoMap project is to train the researcher, who has a background in GAGomics, proteoglycan biology and bioinformatics, with expanded skills and expertise in N-/O-glycomics, organoid culture, hi-resolution 3D imaging and advanced bioinformatics in the context of breast cancer, augmenting her future career opportunities, as well as establishing unbiased top-down integrated glycomics to support breast cancer analyses, diagnostics and the development of novel treatments.",,,,2023,2025,,,,,,,,

LIVERATION,,LIVERATION,Unravelling the impact of Radiofrequency in liver surgery: the key to decrease local recurrence?,RIA - Diagnosis and treatment,,http://liveration.eu/,,,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks fourth in cancer deaths worldwide. Between 20% and 30% of patients with advanced CRC have liver metastases (CRLM). Liver cancer ranks second in cancer deaths worldwide, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite recent advances, liver resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with liver metastases. However, the recurrence rate of these tumours is high even after post-resection. The presence of positive margins in the remaining liver after resection correlates with increased local recurrence and decreased overall survival, the only factor where prognosis could be influenced by the performance of surgery. However, at present, the extent of an R-negative status remains debatable and varies widely from one publication to another. Currently, there are radiofrequency ablation studies that, based on preliminary retrospective human clinical trials, are able to correlate an additional coagulation of tumor margins with a reduction on local recurrence. However, there is no prospective and pragmatic controlled study that accurately measures this additional margin and its impact on oncological outcomes. The aim of LIVERATION is to conduct an ambitious, pragmatic multicenter clinical trial with 720 patients with CRLM and HCC at 24 clinical centres in 6 different countries to determine whether additional ablated margin produced by radiofrequency can decrease the recurrence rate and improve patient survival. We will also evaluate the patient-centredness of the intervention and its comparativeness with other therapeutic alternatives in terms of quality of life and patient experience in real-world settings. To this end, the consortium has been formed by highly experienced, highly qualified and multidisciplinary entities to carry out the project successfully.

LUCIA,,LUCIA,Understanding Lung Cancer related risk factors and their Impact,RIA - Prevention and Early Detection,,https://hope.be/EU_Projects/lucia/,,,"Smoking tobacco is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer. However, it is not the only risk factor. For example, uranium (found in rocks and soils) is a cancer-causing agent. So is asbestos, arsenic, nickel, coal smoke, soot and diesel fumes. The EU-funded LUCIA project will focus on personal risk factors, external risk factors, and biological responses to those risk factors. It will develop a toolbox for analysis that will include databases, AI models, wearable devices, sensors and multi-omics. After identifying the effects of various risk factors, the project will study the molecular changes associated with these risk factors. The findings will be translated into policy recommendations and used in lung cancer screening programmes and digital diagnostics.
Lung Cancer (LC) is the biggest cancer killer worldwide, with five-year survival following diagnosis varying between 5% to 25%. Though tobacco smoking has long been recognized as the major risk factor for LC, many cases (incl. LC patients that are non-smokers) cannot be explained by this reason. In this sense, LUCIA aims to establish a novel toolbox for discovering and understanding new risk factors that contribute to LC development. The toolbox encompasses the analysis of three aspects: (i) personal risk factors, which include a person’s exposure to chemical pollutants and behavioural and lifestyle factors; (ii) external risk factors, such as urban, built and transport environments, social aspects and climate; and (iii) biological responses to the personal and external risk factors, including changes in genetics, epigenetics, metabolism and aging. Key components of the toolbox for analysing personal and external risk factors include retrospective and prospective cohort databases, AI models, wearable devices, novel non-invasive sensors, and multi-omics. Together, these tools will be used to identify the effects of a wide range of environmental, biological, demographic, community and individual-level risk factors associated with the formation of LC. Molecular changes associated with the risk factors identified by this set of tools will then be validated by cell and molecular biology methods and through in vivo analysis. The impact of the identified personal and external risk factors and the associated biological responses will be then validated in three clinical use cases: general population risk assessment and screening, precision screening of high-risk populations, and digital diagnostics. The resulting evidence within LUCIA will be translated into policymaking recommendations, with the aim to implement them in a screening program for LC.

MammoScreen,,MammoScreen,"Innovative and safe microwave-based 
imaging technology to make breast cancer screening more accurate, 
inclusive and female-friendly",RIA - Prevention and Early Detection,,https://mammoscreenproject.eu,,,"In many countries breast cancer screening in women above 40 years of age who are at risk from the disease is performed using mammography, an ionising radiation-based technique. Although it can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, the technology is not suitable for radiographically dense breasts. To address this limitation the EU-funded MammoScreen project proposes to utilise MammoWave for breast screening, a non-invasive technology that employs non-ionising microwave signals. Contrary to mammography, the MammoWave technology does not apply any compression to the breast and is very effective with dense breasts, making it suitable for younger women below the age of 40.
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 women. The figures from WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer estimate that in 2020 worldwide cases of breast cancer accounted for 24% of all cancers in women (2.26 million women and 685,000 deaths globally). Mammography is the gold standard technology for breast screening, which has been demonstrated through different randomized controlled trials to reduce breast cancer mortality. However, it has limitations and potential harms, such as the use of ionizing radiation, breast compression and performance restrictions due to the intrinsic nature of X-rays. In particular, breast density is a restrictive property that can prevent breast cancer detection in mammograms of women with radiographically dense breasts. Other existing techniques (MRI, Ultrasound, biopsy) also suffer from drawbacks. The overall aim of the MammoScreen proposal is to generate evidence about the use of MammoWave (a technology developed by UBT) as screening technique in population-based programs promoted by National or Regional Health Systems, to reach a revolution in breast screening. To do so, the consortium aims to confirm that MammoWave reaches sensitivity>90% and specificity>95% in BC detection on 10000 study participants undergoing regular screening programs. MammoWave uses safe non-invasive and non-ionizing microwave signals, does not apply any compression to the breast and is very effective with dense breasts. Hence it can extend the breast screening to younger women aged 20-49 (98 million women in Europe). This group accounts for ~30% of breast cancers in 2020. A comprehensive health economic assessment will be undertaken in this project and innovative way to implement patient engagement approaches is sought. An effective policy makers’ engagement plan will be carried out to ensure that MammoWave is recommended as screening approach due to the benefits that it brings to women and healthcare systems.

Accounting for 12.4 % of all cancer deaths, only one in seven EU citizens participate in screening programmes. The EU-funded ONCOSCREEN project aims to reverse this trend by promoting accurate, non-invasive, cost-effective screening tests based on new technologies and an increased awareness on the disease. Personalised approaches for screening are needed to consider genetic and other socioeconomic variables and environmental stressors. With this in mind, the project will develop a risk-based, population-level stratification methodology for CRC to account for genetic prevalence, socioeconomic status and other factors. Bringing together a 38-partner consortium, the project is in line with Horizon Europe’s Cancer Mission.
With Colorectal Cancer (CRC) being accountable for 12.4% of all deaths due to cancer, and with only 14% of EU citizens participating in screening programmes, there is an urgent need for accurate, non-invasive, cost-effective screening tests based on novel technologies and an increased awareness on the disease and its detection. Furthermore, personalized approaches for screening are needed, to consider genetic and other socioeconomic variables and environmental stressors that lead to different onsets of the disease. ONCOSCREEN responds to these challenges by developing a risk-based, population-level stratification methodology for CRC, to account for genetic prevalence, socio-economic status, and other factors. It complements this methodology by a) developing a set of novel, practical, and low-cost screening technologies with high sensitivity and specificity, b) leveraging AI to improve existing methodologies for CRC screening, allowing for the early detection of polyps and provision of a personalized risk status stratification, and c) providing a mobile app for self-monitoring and CRC awareness raising. Furthermore, ONCOSCREEN develops an Intelligent Analytics dashboard for policy makers facilitating effective policy making at regional and national levels. Through a multi-level campaign, the above-mentioned solutions are tested and validated. For the clinical solutions specifically, a clinical validation study has been planned with the participation of 4100 enrolled patients/citizens.

PANCAID,,PANCAID,PANcreatic CAncer Initial Detection via liquid biopsy,RIA - Diagnosis and treatment,,https://pancaid-project.eu/,,,"Tumours release tiny amounts of cells or cellular material into the blood circulation. This is the basis for the diagnosis potential of liquid biopsies which, however, often suffer from reduced sensitivity or specificity. The EU-funded PANCAID project focuses on developing a diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The test will combine multiple biomarkers and AI for analysis for high accuracy and sensitivity. Given the dismal prognosis of pancreatic cancer, the PANCAID test is expected to assist early detection for better management and clinical outcomes.
Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is usually detected at late stages and most patients die within one year after diagnosis. In PANCAID we will therefore develop a blood test for early detection of PDAC. Despite tremendous technological advances in Liquid Biopsy Diagnostics (LBx), this goal is very ambitious because small tumors release only minute amounts of cells or cellular products (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites) into the circulation. Thus, tests with a high sensitivity are required but increases in sensitivity are usually achieved on the expenses of reduced specificity which can lead to significant overdiagnosis leading to unnecessary stress for the individuals with a false-positive blood test and high costs for the health system. In PANCAID, we will therefore establish a blood test with high accuracy by analyzing large cohorts of patients with PDAC and its precursor lesions, individuals at risk to develop PDAC and appropriate age-matched control groups (healthy and non-cancer diseases frequent in the targeted population). 
Ambitious objectives of PANCAID include (1) establishment of a unique resource of blood samples of early PDAC and risk groups (WP1); (2) Establishment of a breakthrough blood test for early diagnosis of PDAC (WP2); (3) Identification of the best composite biomarker panel by integrating multimodal features in an AI-assisted computational analysis; (4) Analysis of the socio-economic impact of early PDAC diagnosis (WP4); and (5) Definition of the ethics parameters relevant to early PDAC detection (WP5). A robust multi-biomarker panel will be determined during the training period (year 1-3) and subsequently validated on bio-banked blood samples (year 4-5). Depending on the outcome of this comprehensive analysis, PANCAID will provide the design of a future prospective study for validation of the developed composite blood test in an international multi-center setting required to introduce LBx into screening programs for high-risk individuals.

Then, it introduces new multi-actor and context-aware interventions along with new user engagement strategies to face the current upscaling bottlenecks; multi-actor in the sense that they target different types of users (e.g. students, family, educators, policymakers) and context-aware in the sense that PREVENT interventions are tailored to the specific implementation places (class, canteen, sports fields, labs, outside school). The PREVENT new policies are adapted, piloted, and scaled up within the schools’ communities of three European countries facing different epidemiological settings on childhood obesity, geographic, socio-economic and cultural attributes. The pilots are designed to be holistic end-to-end ecosystems, including users, medical professionals, policymakers, public authorities, and civil communities.

PROTECT- trial,,PROTECT- trial,Proton versus photon therapy for esophageal cancer - a trimodality strategy,RIA - Diagnosis and treatment,,https://protecttrial.eu/,,,"Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of many cancers. However, as conventional radiotherapy can cause side effects in surrounding organs, the dose is limited meaning that treatment takes longer and can be less effective. Proton therapy is an innovative form of radiotherapy. As the treatment is more focused on the tumour itself, a higher dose can be delivered while limiting damage to other, healthy organs, leading to shorter treatment for patients, and hopefully, better outcomes.

The aim of the PROTECT-trial project is to compare the results of proton therapy and radiotherapy for people with cancer of the oesophagus whose treatment also includes chemotherapy and surgery. The team will do this by carrying out a clinical trial involving 400 patients in 9 countries. Among other things, they will assess the impact of the two treatments on tumour control, survival, and the severity of side effects.

If the results of the trial come out in favour of proton therapy, it could become a standard treatment option for patients with cancer of the oesophagus. The hope is that with proton therapy, patients will recover faster and experience fewer side effects, dramatically improving their quality of life. The project will also provide evidence of the economic impacts of proton therapy, something which will help with health technology assessment (HTA) and reimbursement decisions in Europe.

Although PROTECT-trial focuses on cancer of the oesophagus, the results will have implications for many other cancers where proton therapy could replace standard radiation therapy.",,,,2021,2027,,,,,,,,

Recent studies identified a patient population (~14,000 patients / year in Europe), whose prognostic is poor (5 year-overall survival (OS) <20%) due to a refractory cancer, characterized by a poor chemosensitivity (assessable online with the numeric CA-125 KELIMTM score <1.0) and by a disease found non-resectable disease after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy. In these patients, there is a high uncertainty about the best treatment adjustments to apply. 
SALVOVAR is a European project led by HCL, meant 1) to raise the physician awareness, and propose practical and affordable diagnostic tools for identifying these patients, and 2) to assess the utility (OS benefit), acceptability (quality-of-life; patient perception) and affordability (cost-effectiveness, including country coverage policies) of solutions based on adjustments of their medical-and-surgical treatment. These solutions implementable in routine may improve their prognosis, according to recent literature data. The project will be based on a large pragmatic randomized phase III trial, sponsored by ARCAGY-GINECO group, and activated in 6 countries (ENGOT network; ~100 recruiting centers), with the objective of demonstrating an OS benefit with the chemotherapy densification (weekly carboplatine-paclitaxel dose-dense regimen) compared to the continuation of the standard 3-weekly regimen. Total 685 patients treated with the standard neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will be pre-screened to randomize 240 patients.

IMAGIO,,IMAGIO,Imaging and advanced Guidance for Workflow Optimisation in Interventional Oncology,RIA - Diagnosis and treatment,,https://imagioproject.eu/,,,"Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in six deaths. Lung and liver cancers were among the top three leading causes of cancer death in 2020 with 1.8 million and 830.000 deaths, respectively. On the other hand, soft tissue sarcomas are relatively uncommon cancers diagnosed in about 1% of all adults, but much more common in children and young adults, accounting for 7–10% of paediatric malignancies; they are an important cause of death in the 14–29 years age group.

Interventional Oncology involves miniaturized instruments (biopsy needles, ablation electrodes, intravascular catheters) and minimally-invasive access, guided by imaging techniques (X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) – to target cancer with ablative or localized drug delivery strategies. Interventional Oncology can be used as a stand-alone approach, or in combination with the other approaches (‘pillars’) to enhance treatment efficacy. 

While cancer survival has significantly improved over time through innovations in each individual pillar, our current understanding of cancer now leads us to an intertwining of pillars and multimodal care pathways: Interventional Oncology is uniquely suited to leverage and enhance the effects of the conventional therapy pillars, while reducing the burden on the healthcare system.

IMAGIO will leverage Interventional Oncology in the clinical setting to improve the cancer survival outcomes, through minimally invasive, efficient, and affordable care. 
We will deliver four complete, multimodal care pathways for two of the most aggressive cancers (liver, lung) and one of the most debilitating when treated with current approaches (sarcoma):
1. Multimodal interventional imaging for fast and precise radioembolization therapy of liver cancer; 
2. Multimodal ablation therapy of liver cancer; 
3. Multimodal diagnosis and therapy in early-stage lung cancer; and 
4. Multimodal MR-HIFU-enabled therapy for abdominal sarcoma. 

IMAGIO will mature the next-generation interventional imaging across the full spectrum, from pre-clinical developments to impact validation in clinical trials. Expertise on Interventional Oncology and immunotherapy will be leveraged from pioneering clinical research centres and leading industry covering the full value chain of oncological care, as well as cancer patient and professional organisations. Such synergetic partnerships will accelerate the impact of the technologies and transform the way healthcare solutions are delivered, providing access to safe, fast, and effective care. By focusing on the local delivery of therapy, IMAGIO will drive the substitution of conventional higher dose systemic alternatives or invasive surgical approaches, thereby accelerating recovery, reducing complication rates and the number of patient visits.",,,,2023,2027,,,,,,,,

This will allow us to replace the current state-of-the-art of human-developed cancer grading systems. However, the field is currently hindered by significant knowledge gaps: we do not know how to effectively leverage both global and local information in WSIs, how to identify pan-cancer prognostic features, and how to make machine learning models explainable and interpretable. In this project, I will address these key knowledge gaps by building on the novel stochastic streaming gradient descent developed in my group. Specifically, I will integrate innovative multi-task and cross-task learning algorithms with SSGD. Furthermore, I will leverage the latest advances in self-supervision, self-attention and natural language processing to endow deep neural networks with unprecedented transparency and explainability. Last, the project will validate our developed methodology in the largest dataset of oncological WSIs in the world, and, for the first time, identify links between morphological prognostic features and genetic features.

Interpretation is a bottleneck for the full deployment and broad accessibility of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in cancer management. The project tackles the 3 main hurdles in the interpretation of cancer mutations: it is not systematic, it deals with a majority of variants of unknown significance and it fails to empower patients.

The interpretation of tumor genomic data relies on the work of experts reviewing scattered databases and resources, in a time-consuming process that may lead to suboptimal clinical decisions. CGI-clinics will systematize the interpretation process by integrating relevant public and private databases hospitals in a one-stop shop tool, with the possibility to organize virtual molecular tumor boards co-facilitated by reference hospitals. Project will have three phases: a setup (assess needs), validation (pilot with the 9 clinical partners) and replication (30 hospitals across EU). It will enable democratization of genomic data interpretation (independent of their size, resources and profiling technology) and provide health economics validation.

Relying on a systematic automatic learning platform, GCI-Clinics will increase the share of interpretable variants in tumors (from the current 9-12% to at least 50%), and features that constitute biomarkers of drug response. The interpretation process is complex for most cancer patients, alienating them from knowledge of their illness. CGI-Clinics will build eduCGI, an app to help them understand the information gained through interpretation of their tumors, facilitating informed discussions with clinicians and sharing their data for research.

Precision oncology is the future of fighting cancer. In efforts to test new technological and methodological concepts, Cancer Core Europe developed the Basket of Basket study to provide personalised treatment to a larger number of patients by incorporating a molecular profiling platform, flexible modules targeting different molecular alterations and a data/sample collection plan to enable translational research. The EU-funded CCE_DART project will improve efficiencies and transform platform trials into data-rich translational research programmes. It will develop digital tools for trial management; integrate imaging and molecular markers of tumour progression and drug response; develop a new clinical trial methodology; and increase patient engagement.

Successful drug approvals on Precision Oncology (PO) using basket studies have uncovered new challenges. Research in small patient populations suffers from sustainability/ logistical issues. Platform trials are flexible solutions to test different drugs in different populations but encompass management issues that compromise flow and translational research. This is detrimental to patients/ researchers thus new technological/ methodological concepts must be urgently implemented. To overcome these limitations, Cancer Core Europe (CCE) has developed the Basket of Basket (BoB) study to provide personalized treatment to a larger number of patients by incorporating a multi-tiered molecular profiling platform, flexible modules targeting different molecular alterations and a data/ sample collection plan to enable translational research. The CCE-DART model, here proposed, is conceived to address other limitations of PO and platform trials identified by our multi-disciplinary team. With a new design, we aim to improve efficiencies and transform platform trials in data-rich translational research programs, by: (1) developing digital systems (information-technology solutions) facilitating data management and clinical-decision-making; (2) integrating accurate, dynamic imaging and molecular markers of tumor progression/ drug response; (3) using more efficient, adaptive clinical trial methodology; (4) increasing patient engagement. To achieve this, we will use harmonized data-sharing/ technological/ legal/ clinical infrastructure developed in CCE and the BoB trial that will be leveraged as a use case for testing the new model.

Although immunotherapeutics are effective not all patients benefit and side effects vary greatly. Thus, there is an unmet need for a personalized approach. Blood and tissue biomarkers have played only a modest role up until now in assessing immune status in vivo and we believe that non-invasive whole body imaging will make a significant contribution in the future. Although the field of imaging (PET, MRI, Optical Imaging) is flourishing, its application to patient immune status measurement and monitoring has barely been explored. Within Immune-Image we aim to develop new immunotracers for imaging specific immune cell subsets, develop quantitative imaging workflows, validate the immunotracers pre-clinically in relevant disease models, produce the tracers in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant way, and conduct smart clinical trials, including with novel tracers. To this end, insights will be gained into the optimal use of drugs and a more efficient development of immunotherapeutics. Moreover, the success rate of immunotherapy development will be enhanced since our molecular imaging platform will provide novel insights into patient immune status, which will support drug development and treatment decisions. 

To achieve our goals, we have assembled an experienced international multi-disciplinary consortium composed of chemists, biologists, immunologists, physicists, pharmacists, information technologists, and medical specialists with diverse and essential backgrounds who will join forces to design, synthesise, evaluate and validate immunotracers and create sustainable molecular imaging techniques that can be broadly applied in the assessment of the immune status and immune modulation of patients.

The HEAP platform will also analyse data from large and population-based cohorts on the health effects of purchased products using consumer receipts, and data from volunteer cohorts that carry sensors for continuous monitoring of environmental exposures.",9f985825498647bbae0837e0c0049395,,,,,,,,,,"CSC,CON,MAT,CONSTANCES,HPV,LSC,WDC",,
PERCH,,PERCH,PartnERship to Contrast HPV,EU4health - Prevention,,https://www.projectperch.eu/,,,"HPV can cause cervical cancer in women and anogenital and head and neck cancers in both sexes. HPV 16 and HPV 18 genotypes cause around 70% of cases of cervical cancer, which kills around 26 000 women a year in Europe.

Cervical cancer is highly preventable through HPV vaccination and screening. However, in 2020 vaccination programme coverage in the WHO European region was only 31%.

PROTECT-EUROPE,,PROTECT-EUROPE,Vaccinating Europe to protect against the cancers caused by HPV,EU4health - Prevention,,https://www.europeancancer.org/eu-projects/impact/protect-europe,,,"Around 67 500 HPV-related cancers are diagnosed in the EU every year. They include cervical, anal, vaginal, penile, head and neck cancers.

Achieving the EU ambition of eliminating HPV-related cancers entails promotion, implementation and high uptake of gender-neutral HPV vaccination throughout the EU.

In many countries, uptake is too low to achieve the herd protection levels required for elimination of HPV-related cancer. Vaccine hesitancy is an obstacle to high uptake.

PROTECT-EUROPE aims to tackle this problem on two levels.

It will provide information and training for healthcare professionals involved in HPV vaccination on one-to-one communication with young people and their parents/carers. Training will be delivered online and the knowledge will then be disseminated via a train-the-trainer approach.
It will provide EU Member States and civil society organisations active in public health with guidance and campaign tools for promoting vaccination among young people and their parents/carers.

The campaign tools will be designed for a range of platforms, including social media, websites, posters and leaflets. The potential of sport, specifically football, as an influencer will be explored. Particular attention will be paid to addressing issues of equality and diversity.

All project outputs will be made available via an online hub and disseminated via a final report and a high-level event.",,,,2023,2024,,,,,,,,

It is a set of recommendations on how to reduce your risk of cancer and is a key instrument for preventing cancer in Europe. ECAC5 will be the latest (5th) revision of the Code, integrating the emerging scientific evidence of the past decade and including policy recommendations.

Revise, update and expand the evidence-based recommendations of the ECAC 4th edition,
Harmonize cancer-specific recommendations with those for other non-communicable diseases,
Plan the dissemination of the ECAC throughout the EU including hard-to-reach populations,
Develop synergies with other health prevention strategies,
Propose novel ways to adapt ECAC to local contexts and social differences,
Propose sustainable and systematic evaluation of the impact of the ECAC across the EU.",,,,2022,2026,,,,,,,,

This should enable a continuous evaluation and improved performance. The data will be integrated into the European Cancer Information System (ECIS).

The project will refine performance indicators for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening and develop new indicators for lung cancer screening. These indicators will allow for the comparison of screening programmes in different settings, and the monitoring of inequalities, as well as for additional indicators to cover new screening approaches and cancer sites.

A data warehouse and web application will be created for providers of screening data to access the tools and submit data. The web application will analyse the data received and display validated data as interactive graphs, tables, and charts, providing a user-friendly means of monitoring indicators and supporting decision-making.",,,,2022,2024,,,,,,,,

The EU-CanIneq project aims to coordinate a research and data framework to develop and expand indicators of socioeconomic inequalities in cancer, with the following objectives:

collect and harmonise data on socioeconomic inequalities in cancer in the EU;
produce indicators on socioeconomic inequalities in cancer for the European Cancer Inequalities Registry;
analyse, map, compare, and discuss socioeconomic inequalities in cancer in the EU;
provide country-specific information on socioeconomic inequalities in cancer in Europe;
disseminate findings through scientific reports, a project website, and leaflets.

The project will focus on total cancer mortality and mortality from the most common types of cancer by educational level, gender, age, and geographical area. Led by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the project will collect data through infrastructure in the Netherlands, relying on workshops to address data gaps. It will play a vital role in beating cancer and reducing inequalities across the EU.",,,,2023,2025,,,,,,,,
JANE,,JANE,Joint Action on Networks of Expertise,"Joint Action,EU4health - Diagnosis and Treatment",,https://jane-project.eu/,,,"JANE - Joint Action on Networks of Expertise is establishing shaping seven EU Networks of Expertise (NoEs) for cancer care- related issues that require cross-border cooperation and European-level know-how. The issues include: 

complex cancers, 
poor prognosis cancers, 
palliative care, survivorship, 
personalised primary cancer prevention, 
‘omics’ technologies, 
hi-tech medical resources, and 
adolescents and young adults with cancer.

These Networks of Expertise will provide services and tools to European cancer institutions and networks. Five transversal task forces will focus on issues important to cancer-related networking in the EU today, such as integration between healthcare and research, integration of health systems, and electronic health records, including through the use of artificial intelligence tools.

JANE partners with other Joint Actions, networks, and forums to enhance European efforts to tackle cancer, and stakeholder engagement is encouraged through surveys and questionnaires. The main goals of JANE are to launch the NoEs and evaluate existing networking models to optimise the functioning of the NoEs.

By fostering coordinated relationships within the European oncology community, JANE aims to find solutions that allow patients across the EU to benefit from increased knowledge and expertise and more accessible health services.",,,,2022,2024,,,,,,,,
