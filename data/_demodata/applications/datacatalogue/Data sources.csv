Recently, during the ""Oncological Atlas"" project which aimed to use spatial models of cancer incidence, together with survival and mortality not related to municipal administrative areas, information was added to georeference the cases and the resident population.","Currently the registry is able to map oncological disease using the ISTAT census sections with the consequent possibility of linking other information relating to the general population such as those produced by Istat with the 'General Population and Housing Censuses' or the 'Censuses of the Industry and Services'.

 The working methodology of the register, now consolidated in many population registers, is based on the temporal and orderly succession of survey activities with ""linkage"" strategies. It makes use of the integrated coding of healthcare sources, i.e. automated procedures that allow, through appropriate software, to distinguish and select the relevant information present in healthcare flows. Furthermore, their integration with other independent flows is carried out and finally we proceed to identify, pre-populate and make available for manual verification, computerized forms containing a mass of data on possible new tumor diagnoses already codified. 
The activity of the Registry operators starts from the outcome of the automated linkage and pre-coding procedures, verifies its completeness and quality and integrates it where necessary with further information derived from clinical documentation. The skills of the operators and in-depth knowledge of new recording techniques are a fundamental requirement to ensure high levels of quality.
Algorithms
 for reading the text of the reports were adopted as a solution as they are able to extract, even from plain text, the information necessary for coding, allowing even non-codified reports from non-codified pathological anatomy laboratories to be coded. 
The automated import of data from the main information flows is therefore accompanied by a manual entry procedure. In the first case, every possible new tumor notification is carefully prepared by the software and recorded with a “waiting” status. It is subsequently checked by an expert operator who proceeds to find all the documentation that can confirm or exclude the notification of the tumor in question. In the second case, the operator manually inserts cases obtained from other possible information sources",2008-01-01,2008-01-01,2020-12-31,13 years,,,1100000,0,Italy,,"All ages,Infant (0-23 months),Newborn (0-1 months),Infants and toddlers (2-23 months),Child (2-12 years),Adolescent (13-17 years),Adult (18+ years),Young adult (18-24 years),Adult (25-44 years),Middle-aged (45-64 years),Aged (65+ years),Aged (65-79 years),Aged (80+ years)","Immigration,Disease diagnosis",,"Death,Emigration",,"C00 Malignant neoplasm of lip,""C00-C14 Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity and pharynx"",""C00-C75 Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of specified sites, except of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue"",C00-C97 Malignant neoplasms,C00.0 Malignant neoplasm of lip -
