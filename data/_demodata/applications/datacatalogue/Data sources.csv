ABL,,ABL,ABL Region Administrative Databases,,,,,,ARS.TOSCANA,,"As is the case in every Italian region, the reason for entering the database is the registration with a primary care physician, which may happen upon immigration or upon birth; the reason for exiting the database is emigration or death. Beyond administrative databnls, for the same underlying population other data banks are collected by the Tuscany Region or by other Tuscan organizations: the birth registry, the spontaneous abortions and induced terminations registry, the death registry, the vaccine registry, the pathology registry, the registry of primary care community centers, the COVID registry, the congenital anomaly registry and the rare disease registry.  Medical records and/or laboratory results are collected by local organizations, such as hospital, on subsets o teh underlying Tuscan population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DHL,,DHL,Dutch institute for health and welfare,,,,,,DHL.I,,"Currently, the Netherlands has multisource financing of healthcare. Universal health insurance coverage is accessible for all citizens and permanent residents in the country, with a range of comprehensive health services. Municipalities (currently around 300) are responsible for arranging and funding health care. Health services are divided into primary health care and specialized medical care. Primary health care refers to the municipally arranged services provided at municipal health centres. Specialised medical care refers to secondary and tertiary health care, provided by experts on medical specialities largely provided in hospitals. Municipalities or joint municipal authorities may also procure health care services from private service providers. Employers are responsible for preventive health care of their employees. On a voluntary basis, some also provide medical care. Medical care provided by employers and private healthcare also receive some public funding.

Finnish Instititute for Health and Welfare (THL) collects information and produces a range of statistics in the field of social welfare and health care. As a statistical authority, THL is responsible for the maintenance and development of statistical and register resources. THL is hosting the Drugs and Pregnancy research project, a joint project of the THL, the Finnish Medicines Agency (FIMEA) and the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The project aims to secure safe medical drug use during pregnancy. 

The underlying population of all the data banks is the whole population of Finland (around 5.6 million inhabitants).
