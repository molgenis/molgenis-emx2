For example, a person with movement disorders may not request a co-pay exemption because they may not need it and it's an administrative burden, or are afraid of stigma

Another point to bear in mind is that some co-payment exemptions trump others; for example, a patient may have a rare disease and a poor socioeconomic status, but since the exemption for socioeconomic status is more economically advantageous, the patient may opt for the latter.
