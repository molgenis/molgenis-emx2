Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank,21.12110/1.59E0-0A68-D025,,Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank,,,http://multirtb.leeds.ac.uk/index.php,,,"Background:  The Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James’s University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.    The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 yeasr later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).      Current situation:  The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established.From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.      Sample processing and clinical data:  Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.    Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

BIB,,BIB,Born in Bradford,,Multicultural,https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/,BRI,,"Born in Bradford (BiB) started in 2007 as a response to the poor health outcomes for children in Bradford. Pregnant women were recruited when they attended the Bradford Royal Infirmary for their routine maternity care. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about different aspects of their lives including demographics information, physical and mental health and socio-economic information.

Between 2007 and 2011, 12,453 pregnant women were recruited and 3,353 of their partners. Participants also gave permission for routine data linkage for themselves and their children. The BiB cohort is split between approximately 50% South Asian and 50% non-South Asian participants.

BiB has completed a number of sub-sample studies including BiB1000, which focused on exploring ethnic variation and risk factors of childhood obesity. Data collection included questionnaires with parents when the children were between 6 and 36 months at 6 monthly intervals.The ALLIN and MeDALL studies focused on the relationships between childhood allergies and infections. Data collection for these studies were done via a questionnaire and, for the MeDALL study, children were asked to have a skin allergy test.

Since 2016, BiB have undertaken a full cohort follow-up compromising of home visits for data collection through questionnaires, school visits where children carried out cognitive assessments, and a child measurement programme where children were weighed and measured, had their activity levels measured, and were asked to give a blood sample.

From the findings of these studies, BiB have developed a range of additional research projects such as evaluating and developing new interventions to improve health; for example, focusing on reducing childhood obesity, increasing physical activity, improving oral health and improving mental wellbeing. BiB have gone beyond functioning as an observational birth cohort and are actively trying to build and strengthen local research capacity and translate evidence to practice.",,Birth cohort,,Longitudinal,,,,"Retrospective,Prospective",,,12453,,,Bradford,,,,2007,,,,,,,Closed dataset,,No,,general research use,return to database or resource,"Born in Bradford allows researchers to apply to access the study data through the BiB Executive Group.

CT26 colon adenocarcinomas (Judenhofer M.S. et al., 2008) and MC38 colon adenocarcinomas will be studied for imaging protocol establishment (Table 3). Similarly, human immunotracers will be characterised and validated in tumour xenograft bearing humanised mice responsive to bispecific antibody treatment described in WP5 (HER2-TCB (Rius Ruiz I. et al., 2018) (Slaga D. et al., 2018) on models of breast cancers and CEA-TCB (Bacac M. et al., 2016) on models of gastrointestinal tumour cancer) (VHIO, VHIR) (Table 3). Note that advanced longitudinal cancer immune therapy monitoring studies in these susceptible cancers as well as in unresponsive or only partially responsive cancers will be exclusively addressed in WP5. Thus, the focus in Task 4.4 is on making for each of the targets a selection of a lead compound immunotracer among those developed in WP3 and other form (Table 2), so that an optimal tumour-to-background ratio is obtained in imaging (VUB, VIB) and on tracking the homing patterns of cells of interest into “hot” carcinomas, draining lymph nodes and spleen at the time point with the strongest immune cell homing. In addition, mice bearing syngeneic GL261 gliomas will be used to assess whether nanobody tracers developed in WP3 can effectively reach brain lesions (VUB, VIB). This will allow the establishment of dedicated image acquisition and analysis protocols and workflows, which will serve as input information for WP5. In an identical manner we will investigate inflammatory diseases of interest associated with homing of activated CD4/CD8 T-lymphocytes and macrophages: RA (using a collagen induced arthritis (CIA) immunisation model (polyarticular) in mice or antigen induced arthritis model (AIA) (monoarticular) in rats (Chandrupatla D.M.,2015; Noort A.R. et al. 2014)) IBD (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis (Schwegmann K. et al., 2016)), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis (Videla S. et al., 2001), and vasculitis (anti-MPO IgG and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated glomerulonephritis (Table 3). The latter model is characterised by a high influx of macrophages. Subsequent MPO injections induce an extended CD4 and especially CD8 T-lymphocyte response. In case, immunotracers binding to human targets in arthritis lack cross-reactivity to rat or murine binding sites, the humanised immune system (HIS) model with arthritis induction in mice can be applied for validation of in vivo binding and biodistribution (VUMC; Legrand, Weijer & Spits, 2008) (Table 3). Non-invasive in vivo imaging using different modalities will be performed, to reveal the pros and cons of the different modalities and optimise imaging and analysis workflows. Ex vivo validation (histology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, autoradiography, gamma-counting, etc.) will be performed as described in Task 4.2. Endoscopy will enable visualisation of infiltrating or resident cells of interest within the inflamed joints of arthritic mice or within the inflamed mucosa of mice with experimental colitis. Cre-switchable sr39tk C57BL/6 PET reporter mice described in Task 4.3 will be investigated for cross-validation. Genetically modified or 89Zr- or 64Cu-labelled immune cells of interest (derived from mice, rats or humans; employing new cell labelling techniques established in Task 3.5) can be adoptively transferred into littermates for cross-validation through their bystander homing into tumours, inflamed joints, colon, vessels and lymph nodes. Immunotracer kinetics in the target tissues will be additionally analysed by pharmacokinetic modelling and kinetic parameters will be correlated with semi-quantitative parameters, to assess the feasibility of simplified acquisition and analysis protocols. PET and MR images will be co-registered in order to determine the sensitivity and specificity for their immune cell targets. As described before, functional MR information (e.g. diffusion and perfusion) will be used to reveal potential immunotracers in vivo and intra-organ distribution barriers. The multi-parametric complementary image information will be comprehensively analysed with advanced machinelearning-based methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune-Image_Task_6.2a,,Task 6.2a,Serial CD8 PET imaging in cancer patients before and during immune checkpoint inhibition,,,,UMCG,,"Upfront imaging of CD8 (Pandit-Taskar N. et al., J Nucl Med 2018, abstract) is feasible in patients, however data on serial imaging are lacking. When T-cells encounter tumour antigens they are activated and promote lymphocyte proliferation and recruitment to the tumour site. This inflammatory response increases blood flow and vascular permeability, which can be measured with dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Early after starting treatment, immune activation will also lead to T-cell tumour infiltration and increased tumour cellularity, which potentially can be quantified by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and radiomics features derived from computational image analysis. Preliminary data suggests that texture measures can capture the spatial heterogeneity of different sites of disease and predict treatment resistance and progression-free survival in the metastatic setting. Moreover, MRI measurements that integrate whole tumour volumetry, diffusion-weighted imaging (ADC) and radiomics (texture analysis) (Larkin T.J. et al.; 2014, Booth T.C. et al., 2017; Newman A.M. et al., 2015) may provide a therapy response assessment. Preliminary data suggests that texture measures can capture the spatial heterogeneity of metastases and predict treatment resistance and progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Aim Demonstrate and validate (1) PET with a 89Zrlabelled anti-CD8 minibody, to visualize serially the presence of CD8 expressing T-lymphocytes in cancer patients receiving CIT; (2) contribution of MRI measurements of intra- and inter-site tumour heterogeneity. Study design In patients with potential relevant indication for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition treatment (CIT) (e.g. melanoma or NSCLC) and at least one accessible lesion for biopsy, [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 PET imaging (1.5 mg anti human CD8 minibody [89Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, 37 MBq) will be injected and imaging will be performed before the start and 7 days before the 3rd checkpoint inhibitor administration. Whole body [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 distribution will be determined: tumour and normal organ radioactive tracer uptake will be quantified as standardized uptake values (SUV). Patients will undergo multi-parametric MR before and after the 1st cycle and before the 3rd cycle (drugs administered on 2-3 weekly cycles). The third and final MRI will be performed within ~9 weeks after the start of treatment, or on disease progression, whichever is sooner. All metastases determined to be suitable for MR imaging will be evaluated to assess differential tumour response and pseudo-progression. Patients will also undergo contrast-enhanced CT to determine tumour response using iRECIST. Tumour biopsies will be extensively analysed. Statistical considerations: Initial feasibility will be shown in 12 patients. Depending on the tumour type chosen the number of patients required may be increased in order to have sufficient patients with a tumour response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on the individuals born into this cohort was collected since the 24th gestational week as well as their mothers and, to a lesser extent, fathers. The cohort included 12055 mothers and they had 12068 deliveries (13 women delivered twice).

Cases belonging to survey were determined by the calculated term. A small percentage of the births occurred towards the end of 1965 and early in 1967. The calculated term, as was customary at that time, was counted from the first day of the last menstrual period. Where this date was unknown the expected term was estimated from the  date of commencement of foetal ovements and progress of the pregnancy. The study covered all live born and stillborn infants with birth weight of 600 grams or more.

According to the Finland's central Office of Statistics, births in the study area during 1966 totalled 12527, so study population comprised 96.3 per cent of all births during 1966 in that area. Altogether 12231 children were born into the cohort, 12058 of them live born.

Macrophages are of interest as a biomarker (van der Laken C.J. et al. 2008) and folate receptor imaging (Gent Y.Y. et al. 2013) might permit assessment of tissue macrophages. We will use [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET and OI with the folate receptor binding compound OTL0038. We will combine folate receptor imaging with CD8 imaging with [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 PET. Aim To assess disease activity and early treatmentinduced changes with [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET and OTL0038 OI of dedicated joints. 10 patients with clinically active RA will undergo [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 PET/CT. Study design Patients eligible for anti-TNFα therapy will undergo [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET scans (n=30, of which 10 will also undergo OTL0038 imaging of dedicated arthritic joints or [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 PET) upfront. The [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET group will be imaged again 2 weeks after therapy initiation with 26 week clinical follow-up to determine the predictive value of early [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET for anti-TNFα induced clinical effect. Arthroscopies, guided by imaging, and lymph node and tissue biopsies (before and after 12 weeks) will be performed. Scan results will be compared with clinical parameters of arthritis activity and tissue analyses. Statistical considerations 50% of patients experience a clinical response to anti-TNFα, ≥ 10 patients per response outcome group are required and therefore 20 patients will be included for [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET therapy monitoring. Ten patients are sufficient for baseline investigation of the value of the tracer for assessing disease activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, several tumours show a variable and heterogeneous presence of MMR-expressing macrophages. In this task we intend to initiate a multi-site clinical trial evaluating 68Ga-MMR-PET/CT in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First, we will produce the MMRkit formulation of the drug product under GMP conditions to allow simple on-site radiolabelling with 68Ga.

MMR-PET/CT uptake in tumour lesions and normal tissues will be correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA findings in samples collected across the whole resected lung tissue. The study will be performed with the following statistical considerations: the correlation between quantitative PET uptake and semi-quantitative IHC expression levels and RNA will be assessed using the correlation coefficient Rho.

Bi-specific constructs will be generated by linking two lowaffinity nanobodies targeting CD8β and CD69 (from Task 3.1) with a genetic spacer into a design that only binds strongly to cells expressing both antigens on the cell surface but not when only one of them is expressed. Two approaches will be followed to identify the best performing constructs: (1) a rational approach based on structural data; (2) an unbiased cell selection approach. In method 1, the crystal structure of nanobody-antigen complexes will be determined by VIB of up to 5 anti-CD8β and 5 anti-CD69 nanobodies, and for all an in silico model of nanobody-binding orientation at the cell membrane will be determined. The recombinant proteins for these crystallisations will be provided by Roche. Nanobodies that bind to an antigen in an orientation parallel to the cell membrane will be selected. In these, nanobodyantigen interacting residues will be mutated so as to generate agents with reduced affinity but preserved stability. The low affinity-nanobodies from the CD8β screen will be cloned in a fusion (with peptide linkers) to a set of low affinity nanobodies from the CD69 screen, and vice versa. In method 2, a few low affinity nanobodies from the CD8β screen (from Task 3.1) will be connected, via flexible linkers, to an immune nanobody library from the CD69 screen, and vice versa. The intermediate bi-specific libraries will be phage displayed and subjected to biopanning on CD8+/CD69+ cells under stringent and competitive conditions. CD8+/CD69+ cells will be FACS-sorted and phages rescued by an acid wash. The bi-specific compounds from both methods will be subjected to similar in vitro and in vivo tests as in Task 3.1 by VUB, paying attention to the specificity of the compounds for CD8+/CD69+ cells in comparison with CD8-/CD69+and CD8+/CD69- cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immune-Image_Task_3.3,,Task 3.3,Development of a PET tracer against S100A9,,,,"Roche,Takeda,Pfizer,WWU",,"Alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 are expressed and secreted by activated phagocytes at the site of inflammation and are known to trigger sterile inflammatory processes. S100A8/S100A9 complexes (calprotectin) are widely used biomarkers for monitoring disease activity in IBD, vasculitis and RA and are good biomarkers for predicting response to therapy and risk of relapse due to residual disease activity. Local S100-concentrations are 10-fold higher than serum levels indicating that imaging of local S100A9-expression and release is an even better parameter to monitor inflammation. To assess locally activated phagocytes, S100A9-specific tracers labelled with cyanine-dyes for OI (antibody-based and a small non-peptidic ligand Cy5.5-CES271 that is based on a quinolinecarboxamide structure and binds both murine and human S100A9) have been developed (Vogl T. et al. 2014, Voeller T. et al. 2018). For PET imaging Immune-Image will develop 18F-labelled variants of the non-peptidic S100A9 tracer with modified polarities, including ionic charge, to improve tracer bioavailability and biodistribution. 99mTc-labelled derivatives that have already been synthesised show suboptimal pharmacokinetics (i.e. rapid clearance) and high hepatobiliary excretion, limiting tracer availability at the target (unpublished data). Alternating ionic charges in a universally applicable spacer between bioactive molecule and the label potentially facilitates higher tracer concentration at the target and longer in vivo circulation. These tracers are currently under development and will be applicable also for PET using the SiFAmethodology (mild 18F-labelling conditions, Wängler C. et al. 2012). Exchange of the SiFA-moiety with different chelating units offers also the labelling with 68Ga as cyclotron independent radionuclide as well as 89Zr to get a tracer with longer physical half-life and therefore longer time for investigation via PET. For more insights into the structureactivity-relationship and to improve binding affinity, co-crystallization studies with the S100A8/A9 heterodimer will be performed (supported by Roche), giving guidance in the variation on the quinoline motif. This will be supported by modelling studies with the target protein, providing more information on the possible sites for affinity improvements and manipulation of tracer biodistribution. As a second tracer for S100A9-targeting a new lead structure (N-(2-oxo-3-(trifluoromethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazo[1,2-a]imidazol-3-yl)amides) with a reported ten times higher binding affinity to S100A9 (WO2015/177367), will also be labelled with 18F using a similar approach with guidance by modelling studies. The various [18F]F-S100A9 tracer variants developed in Task 3.3 will be validated in iterative biodistribution studies in WP4, including in available S100A9-deficient mice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immune-Image_Task_4.3,,Task 4.3,Characterisation and validation of immunotracers in an experimental model of chronic inflammation,,,,"UMCG,EKUT,Roche,Bayer,WWU,VHIO,Janssen",,"Advanced PET/MRI, PET/CT and OI investigations for validation of novel and established immune cell tracers will be carried out using the optimal tracer dose and the newly established PET/MRI and OI imaging protocols (based on Tasks 4.1 and 4.2) in a well characterised and standardised, simplified and easy to implement experimental model of chronic cutaneous DTHR (contact dermatitis). This well-characterised mouse model shows reproducible rapid and intense infiltration of all cells of interest (CD4/CD8 T-lymphocytes, macrophages, B-lymphocytes, neutrophils) into the inflamed ears and draining lymph nodes (Thunemann M. et al., 2017). Mice will be sensitised in the abdomen with trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) and - starting seven days later - repetitively (five times, every two days) TNCB-challenged in the right ear to induce chronic cutaneous DTHR (Table 5). The contra-lateral, unchallenged, left ear will serve as an internal “healthy” control ear. The ear as well as the draining cervical lymph node is best suited for in vivo PET/MRI, OI/CT imaging
studies and intravital 2PM of the homing of fluorescently labelled cells of interest for in vivo correlation of tracer binding with cellular distribution patterns. Moreover, for cross-validation of the in vivo imaging results, we will track endogenous cells of interest using Cre-switchable sr39tk C57BL/6 PET reporter mice enabling us to follow the homing of endogenous CD4+/CD8+ T cells (sr39tkCD4/CD8-Cre) or monocyte/macrophage/neutrophils (sr39tkLysM-Cre) or other cells of interest into inflamed ears and the draining lymph nodes with PET/MRI (Thunemann M. et al., 2017). In addition, HoxB8-derived progenitor cells will be differentiated into monocytes (precursors of macrophages) and T-lymphocytes. These cells will be equipped with gene reporters (HSV-1-tk, NIS, luciferase) for tracking by PET, OI and intravital 2PM (Gran S. et al., 2018). We will adoptively transfer these cells as well as fluorescence dye, 89Zr- or 64Cu-labelled immune cells of interest (using established labelling approaches; (Griessinger C.M. et al., 2015) and new labelling approaches (Task 3.5; Vugts D. et al., 2017) into littermates for cross-validation (including in vivo PET/MRI, PET/CT, OI, intravital 2-PM) because of their bystander homing into inflamed ears and draining lymph nodes (Table 3).

The selection process will be based on in vivo imaging performance parameters, such as pharmacokinetics, retention, non-specific background, etc. In addition, we will implement an existing 80 kDa anti-CD4 minibody IAB41 with high affinity for CD4 which will be provided by ImaginAb. We will determine the optimal tracer dose and establish optimised PET/MRI, PET/CT, SPECT/CT and OI protocols for longitudinal studies. For dynamic PET, arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis will be performed in mice and rats. Tracer kinetics in the target tissue will be analysed by pharmacokinetic modelling (e.g. BP, Vt, Ki) in WP2. Immunotracers with unsuitable pharmacokinetics will be returned to WP3 for potential optimisation. Kinetic parameters will be correlated with semi-quantitative parameters, to assess the feasibility of simplified acquisition and analysis protocols. PET and MR images will be co-registered in order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of immune cell targeting. Based on functional MR information, parameters such as diffusion or perfusion will be determined to reveal potential limitations of the immunotracer biodistribution. In vivo imaging in WT, KO or KI mice will be performed. As mentioned before, KI mice will be used in case cross-reactivity is not achievable (e.g. likely for CD8β and/or CD69 based on low homology); CD8β and CD69 KI mice will be developed by VUB and existing PD-1 and PD-L1 KI-mice will be provided by VUMC. CD20 nanobody is not cross-reactive but KI mice are available at VUB). The specificity of human antigen-specific tracers will be determined by comparisons of biodistribution in KI versus WT mice. In addition, the specificity of cross-reactive anti-CD163 and -CD206 nanobodies and the anti-S100A9 tracer will be determined in WT versus respectively CD163, CD206 or S100A9 KO mice, available at WWU, VIB. Imaging experiments, focusing mainly on the lymph nodes and spleen, will be followed by ex vivo metabolite analysis, biodistribution by gammacounter, autoradiography, immunohistochemistry (Bayer), fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis for cross-validation of in vivo PET or OI data. ID mice will be reconstituted with different amounts of genetically modified cells of interest with enhanced or abolished expression of the target of interest and optional additional expression of luciferase (bioluminescence imaging) or fluorescence proteins (for OI, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry) for cross-validation with the ex vivo methods. Finally, we will determine a sensitivity threshold to be based on the number of cells and their surface antigen density that can be identified non-invasively in vivo. Hereto, we will locally inject different amounts of immune cells of interest into the muscle or subcutaneous fatty tissue before immunotracer injection. In addition, we will inject different numbers of in vitro pre-labelled immune cells of interest (e.g. using the methodology developed in Task 3.5) followed by PET/MRI or PET/CT analysis. Multi-parametric image analysis will be performed with advanced, machine learning- supported methods using e.g. spectral clustering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CBK forms part of the structure of CIBER, a public Consortium set up at the initiative of the Carlos III Health Institute (Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness), and belonging to the Rare Diseases Area, created to act as a reference, coordinate and foster excellence research on rare diseases in Spain.
CBK was founded with the aim of serving diagnostic and therapeutic research, facilitating the availability of high-quality biological material to carry this out. Additionally, it was set up to contribute to solve one of the main problems encountered in research on these pathologies: the dispersion of samples due to the low prevalence of rare diseases. This point is of special relevance at a time when the proliferation of different biobanks could hinder the concentration of cases required to carry out research into rare diseases.
CIBERER Biobank adheres to principles for responsible custodianship, which require planning and transparent policies to ensure long-term physical integrity of samples as well as maintaining their privacy and confidentiality.
Biospecimen distribution to researchers is based on principles of scientific merit and access in a timely and equitable manner. Any researcher who wishes to request the CBK for a biological sample should fill in a sample request application form, enclosing a report on the research project for which this is required, as well as any relevant data on the evaluation of its viability (human and financial resources, infrastructure, etc.). The Ethics Committee and the Scientific Committee will proceed to evaluate the appropriateness of donating the biological sample requested and issue a report. If the decision is favorable, the sample will be sent to the applicant, after the researcher in charge has undertaken to comply with the conditions established by current legislation in Data Protection Act and Act 14/2007 on Biomedical Research by signing a Material Transfer Agreement (please refer to Appendix 7). The commitment refers to the proper use of samples, given that they constitute scarce research material with high scientific value and to the confidentiality of the associated information or any that may stem from its study.
The biobank was initially set up according to a centralized model, where all samples were processed, stored and given by the biobank's physical premises. Later on, CIBERER's Scientific Board decided to switch to a mixed centralized/decentralized model in order to include other CIBERER sample collections which are not deposited at the biobank. Thus, at present, the biobank works with both types of collections.",info-biobank@ciberer.es,Biobank,,,,,,,,,,,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune-Image_Task_3.4,,Task 3.4,Development of small peptide tracers for imaging PD-1 and PD-L1,,,,"Roche,Takeda,Janssen,VUMC",,"Two 20 amino acid peptide lead sequences that bind to PD-L1 and one lead sequence that binds to PD-1 have been identified, based on the PD-1/PD-L1 binding domain. In recent publications this strategy has been used to design PD-1 or PD-L1 binding peptides (Caldwell C. et al., 2017; Li Q. et al., 2016), however, the peptides developed were not optimised for PET imaging. Initially, the peptides (synthesis performed by VUMC and supported by Janssen) will be fluorescently labelled and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for PD-L1 and PD-1 using flow cytometry, immunostaining and cell binding assays on genetically engineered cells that express human and mouse PD-L1 or PD-1, and immune cells isolated from mice (WT, KO or KI, provided by VUMC) and humans. In addition, selectivity over PD-L2 will be determined. Peptides will be evaluated for cross reactivity between mouse and human, using recombinant proteins provided by Roche. The peptides will also be assessed for the absence of immune cell activation and in vitro toxicity, in analogy with the in vitro assays described in Task 3.1. These studies will be executed by Roche, supported by VUMC. The stability of the peptides will be evaluated in mouse and human serum. Based on the results, the peptides will be optimised by known chemical modification techniques like cyclisation, D-amino acid and peptidomimetic substitution. These second-generation peptides will again be evaluated for affinity, selectivity, stability and cross reactivity. One compound will be selected for each target and will be radiolabelled with fluorine-18, via well-known strain-promoted click reactions, Al[18F]F chemistry or 68Ga when appropriate. In WP4, the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the peptide(s) will be evaluated in naïve WT, KO and KI mice and in mice implanted with syngeneic tumours responding to CIT. The chemical structure will be optimised to meet PET tracer preferred criteria as good stability, less non-specific binding, and a pharmacokinetic profile appropriate for the radiolabel. Developing new peptide based PD-L1 and PD-1 tracers with optimised characteristics for PET tracers will provide a significant advantage in PET imaging over the currently available PD-L1/PD-1 tracers that are based on therapeutic antibodies or proteins (Maute R.L. et al., 2015). As such, a series of peptide-based PD-1 and PD-L1 radio- and potentially optical tracers will be developed that will be interactively investigated in vivo in WP4 and WP5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune-Image_Task_3.5,,Task 3.5,Radiolabelling of subsets of immune cells for tracking immune cells in vivo,,,,"Takeda,VUMC,EKUT,WWU,Pfizer",,"In Task 3.5 we aim to develop new cell labelling techniques that allow radiolabelling of subsets of cells, providing a novel method to validate the in vivo signal of cell-specific tracers in WP4 (Tasks 4.2-4) and cell-based therapies in WP5. With the development of a new octadentate chelator for 89Zr, DFO* (Vugts D. et al., 2017), the radiolabelling of the cell surface becomes available. Current preclinical techniques comprise the loading of cells with 89Zr-oxine, analogous to 111In-oxine, but this has limitations due to leakage of radioactivity from the cells and chemotoxicity. In a recent publication (Bansal A. et al., 2015) 89Zr-DFO was used to label dendritic cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. However, since 89Zr is not fully coordinated by DFO, radiolabelling efficiency and conjugation to lysines on the cells is not optimal. DFO*-NCS allows for optimal prelabelling (preliminary data generated in house) and post-conjugation and is thus the ideal candidate to radiolabel cells on their surface resulting in stable radiolabelled cells. If this strategy would fail because of pH restrictions for the conjugation reaction, DFO* could be labelled first with Zr-89, followed by activation to its activated ester (e.g. NHS ester or TFP ester) and conjugation to the surface of the cells at neutral pH. NHS esters are more reactive than NCS and therefore a viable back-up option. Alternatively, the same strategy as for optical imaging probes can be applied (Sutton E.J. et al., 2008). Subsets of immune cells (e.g. CD8+/CD69+ T-lymphocytes and others targeted in WP3 and WP4) will be isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) kits or through FACS sorting and procedures will be scaled up for in vivo applications in WP4/WP5. Cell viability and proliferation capacity of labelled cells will be evaluated post-labelling in relation to specific activity as well as efflux rates of 89Zr-DFO* from the labelled cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experience in the supervision of GMP productions of the three tracer classes within Immune-Image indicates that this should be straightforward. GMP production of cold compounds will be performed either by specialised CROs or by UMCG (depending on budget and timelines). Early in the tracer GMP development process we will reach out to national and European regulatory bodies for advice. Irrespective of the nature of the molecule, the process will be optimised for compound generation, purification, formulation and characterisation, as well as GMP production, including the characterisation and stability studies for product release. The 'cold' GMP batch will be used for GMP labelling in Task 3.8, toxicity testing of mock-labelled compounds in WP5, and clinical use in WP6. When a nanobody-GMP-tracer is to be produced, we aim to develop a strain (E. coli or yeast) and an upstream and downstream process with a final yield of at least 50 mg/L fermentation-equivalent, and a batch of at least 1 gram of GMP-grade nanobody.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For PET imaging, we will rely on the versatile experience (both preclinical and clinical) in radiolabelling of small proteins and nanobodies within the consortium (see section 4). When 18F is the isotope of choice, [18F]SFB (Blykers A. et al., 2015) or a strain-promoted click reaction (Zhou Z. et al., 2018) will be employed. For 68Ga labelling, the chelator of choice is NOTA (or its derivative NODAGA), since these are clinically safe to use (Xavier C. et al., 2013). Nanobodies will also be labelled with the long-lived isotope 89Zr through the chelator DFO, to facilitate transport and use at small-animal PET centres without adequate radioisotope production. Labelling with fluorescent dyes and PET isotopes will be performed by VUMC, EKUT, WWU, UMCG, while appropriately formatted and formulated nanobodies (purified from E. coli or P. pastoris fermentations) will be delivered by VUB, VIB. Nanobody labelling will be either on surface-exposed lysine residues, or via the introduction of appropriate conjugation handles at the nanobodies' Cterminus. Bioorthogonal labellings will be performed either via maleimide-chemistry on an unpaired cysteine (Massa S. et al., 2014; Kijanka M. et al., 2013), using sortase-mediated transpeptidation (Massa S. et al., 2016) or through intein-technology and click chemistry (Billen B. et al., 2017). The different labelling strategies will be scrutinised for future implementation in a GMP environment in Task 3.8. Prior to labelling, the nanobodies will be sequence optimised to remove residues prone to oxidation, isomerization or deamidation. The stability of the labelled nanobodies will be analysed in serum, both in vitro and in vivo. The functionality after radiolabelling will be analysed by cell binding studies and FACS and surface plasmon resonance analyses using non-radioactive analogues. When the pharmacokinetic and solubility properties are deemed suboptimal in the in vivo studies in WP4, we will consider adapting the hydrophilicity and hydrodynamic radius of nanobodies by PEGylation (Rashidian M. et al., 2016) or PASylation (Mendler C.T. et al., 2015).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Pregnant women with an expected delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006 living in Rotterdam were eligible for participation in the study. In total, 9778 mothers were enrolled in the study, who gave birth to 9749 live born children. Extensive assessments are performed in mothers, fathers and their children. Measurements were planned in early pregnancy (gestational age <18 weeks), mid pregnancy (gestational age 18–25 weeks) and late pregnancy (gestational age >25 weeks). The fathers were assessed once during the pregnancy of their partner. The children form a prenatally recruited birth cohort that will be followed at least until young adulthood. In the preschool period, which in the Netherlands refers to the period from birth until the age of 4 years, data collection was performed by a home-visit at the age of 3 months, and by repeated questionnaires and routine child health centers visits. Information from these routine visits was obtained and used for the study. Additional detailed measurements of fetal and postnatal growth and development were conducted in a randomly selected subgroup of Dutch children and their parents at a gestational age of 32 weeks and postnatally at the ages of 1.5, 6, 14, 24, 36 and 48 months in a dedicated research center.
 
Around the ages of 6 and 10 years all children and their parents were invited to visit our research center in the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children’s Hospital to participate in hands-on measurements, advanced imaging modalities, behavioural observations and biological sample collection. MRI scans of all participating children were made in order to image abdominal composition, brain, lungs, cardiovascular system, fat tissue, kidney, liver, and hip development. Furthermore, the parents received 6 questionnaires during this period. Children also received their own questionnaire around the age of 10.

Founded in 2010, it initially collected, processed, stored and mainly liquid samples such as urine, serum, plasma and saliva from epidemiological studies of the Leipzig Research Centre for Civilisation Diseases (LIFE) and made them available for research projects.

In 2017, the collection of tissue samples from patients with tumour diseases also started in cooperation with the University Cancer Centre Leipzig (UCCL), the Institute of Pathology, various clinics of Leipzig University Hospital and the Institute of Laboratory Medicine. The focus there is currently on malignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, breast and uterus as well as sarcomas and malignant haematological diseases. Since 2021, samples from patients with cardiovascular diseases have also been stored with the Vascular Centre of Leipzig University Hospital.

The samples are processed in a highly standardised and traceable manner and stored predominantly at temperatures of -80°C or at <-150°C in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. Storage is carried out in strict compliance with an uninterrupted cold chain and constant monitoring. All samples are clearly identified by a barcode and can thus be linked to quality-relevant data such as processing and storage times as well as to clinical data of the donor. This means that comprehensive data sets are also available for the samples. 

The biobank also supports project partners in the planning and implementation of projects regarding sample collection, processing, storage and provision. In this way, it has also been possible to implement sample collections for scientific accompanying projects of clinical studies. Scientists at the University of Leipzig and cooperating institutions can access the biomaterial and database for research purposes via a project agreement.

Using a biochemical assay with successive protein enrichment from frozen brain slices, we isolated ferritin light and heavy chains in a so far not known dominant autosomal disease. Our studies have provided additional knowledge and insights in the growing area of ferritin-related neurodegeneration disease. In the field of Creutzfeldt jakob disease, we provide an alternative biochemical definition of PrPSc diversity and new insights in the perception of Human TSE agents' variability. Different brain areas from 41 sCJD and 12 iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) cases (mainly from the Cerebrotheque de Toulouse) were investigated, using two new biochemical assays.

Besides descrpition of neuropathological lesions, we contributed to a work concluding on the impact of amyloid clearance restablishment on neurite curvature.

Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) has a critical role in regulation of survival of neurons. A previous work on culture cells in our research team (INSERM U858), showed that in vitro, neuronal loss was induced by ?-amyloid peptide 25-35 and it was correlated with alteration of sphingolipid biostat. Our hypothesis is that SphK1 is differentially expressed in neurons regarding their location in the vicinity or far from amyloid deposits in the brain of patients affected with AD.

Actually, always in the same direction, we are interested in an integrative approach which takes into consideration: 1) the different metabolic pathways involved in the CVD, 2) a great number of information on genetics, mRNA and circulating proteins and 3) the intermediate phenotypes in the plasma/serum as well as in the PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) (bank of RNA and protein extracts of PBMCs in the 3rd recruitment of the STANISLAS Cohort, during 2003-2005). In 2008, we associated to this strategy which was essentially focused on the candidate-gene approach, the pangenomic approach. This approach, which enables revealing new loci related to disease, opened new perspectives to our CRB. First, a collaboration with a multi-centric character, with aim to detect new genetic loci in Europeans, which gave new exciting scientific results and enriched our CRB (we regrouped genotyping, phenotypic data and/or biological samples). Second, the European project BioIntelligence, supported by the Agency of Innovation in Industry and the EC. This latest, targets pharmacogenomics.

When the patients are included in various chemotherapy trials initiated by the GOELAMS, samples of bone marrow and blood before treatment are sent to the Goelamstheque in Hopital Cochin. Similarly, in the trials when it is required, patient samples are timely sent to the biobanque according to the protocol to perform biological studies, including the measurement of minimal residual disease. Following specific applications and approval by the GOELAMS scientific committee, many research projects have been conducted using samples frozen in the Goelamstheque.  These projects aimed to characterize the leukemic stem cells, to analyze the signalling pathways dysregulated in blast cells and thereby to identify some specific targets for new therapies in AML.The research group led by Dr P. Mayeux and Dr D. Bouscary (Paris, Cochin) studied protein synthesis and showed  an mTORC1-independent deregulation of oncogenic protein synthesis in human myeloid leukemogenesis. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway has tumor suppressor activity in acute myeloid leukemia through the repression of mTOR-dependent oncogenic mRNA translation.A work in collaboration between Dr C. Recher (Toulouse) and Dr V. Bardet (Paris, Cochin) allowed the characterization of the leukemic stem cells in the population of the CD34+ CD38- CD123+ phenotype.

Our studies have been developed following 3 main directions:-) Identification of caspase-independent cell death as a new means to overcome apoptosis avoidance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) : Drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure in CLL. In search for new molecules that induce PCD via caspase-independent PCD targets and that could open the way to novel therapeutic strategies in CLL treatment, we focused on CD47. This protein is a widely expressed member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, functioning both as a receptor for thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and as a ligand for the transmembrane signal regulatory proteins SIRP? and ?. Our results demonstrate that CD47 engagement in CLL cells is a new and original approach that may be used to specifically eliminate malignant B-lymphocytes by induction of caspase-independent PCD, and this even in CLL cells from drug refractory patients. -) Characterization of various chromosomal aberrations in CLL and other lymphoproliferative disorders: We identified the gain of the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p) as a frequent recurring chromosome aberration, present in 28% of untreated patients with advanced stage CLL  and the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 14. We also described the clinical and biological features of CLL patients with translocations involving IG genes that are recurrent, but uncommon (<5%) in CLL: (14;19)(q32;q13) and t(14;18)(q32;q21).

EVA (European Virus Archive),21.12110/1.AEFE-6066-E615,-,EVA (European Virus Archive),,,http://www.european-virus-archive.com,,,"Virus collections have been generated in small and large laboratories globally. However, their quality and the particular viruses collected usually reflect the interest of the laboratory.  Moreover, when laboratories are re-organized, closed down or the virologist leaves or retires, many of these collections are lost to science. The European Virus Archive (EVA) was conceived as a direct response to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organizations and industry, initially within Europe but ultimately throughout the World.  In preparing the FP7 proposal, it was emphasized that it would be impossible to generate a wide ranging viral archive in a single laboratory complex. Thus, the ""virology club tradition"" was retained by developing an integrated infrastructure via consortia, operating through validated networks. Initially, 9 laboratories within the EU were directly associated to compose the core of the network.  EVA provides access to viruses through European laboratories by integrating their collections and devising validated protocols and effective dissemination procedures, the partner laboratories work to identical high standards in producing and supplying authenticated viruses to the scientific community globally. This has been obtained through intense exchanges of know-how consisting of workshops, trainings and staff exchanges. The current EVA organization is satisfactorily operating: about 1000 products have been distributed worldwide. Ultimately, the EVA network should generate the largest collection of animal and plant viruses in Europe and ultimately in the world and should move beyond the current state-of-the-art to provide a valuable resource and service. To reach its objective to become the key provider of virus and viral derived products worldwide, EVA expands its network at the European level but also outside Europe.",jean-louis.romette@univ-amu.fr,Biobank,,,,,,,,,,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune-Image_Task_3.1,,Task 3.1,"Identification of lead nanobodies targeting CD8β, CD69 & CD163",,,,"UMCG,VUB,Roche,Takeda,Pfizer,WWU",,"We will use nanobody technology as a main vehicle platform for new tracer development as these antibody-fragments have already shown excellent specificity and sensitivity for imaging in oncology and inflammation (De Vos J. et al., 2013; Krasniqi A. et al., 2018). The technology has important features for reaching the ambitious goals of WP3: 1) generation of high affinity binders against virtually any protein of interest is achievable by using a streamlined immunization and selection procedure (Broisat A. et al., 2012); 2) Nanobodies are produced in high yields in microbial fermentation cultures, allowing efficient GMP-grade production and distribution among consortium partners; 3) the small genetic nanobody building block allows development of bispecific/dimeric compounds with potentially improved cell subtype specificity (Hassanzadeh-Ghassabeh G. et al., 2014); 4) nanobodies can be easily co-crystallised with the target antigen to get detailed structural information on the targeted epitope and on the mode of binding (Pardon E. et al., 2014); 5) nanobodies are considered safe for immune-imaging: the monovalent nature of nanobodies avoids target receptor clustering and activation of downstream signalling cascades, and the nanobodies' low immunogenicity profile, predict low toxicity (Keyaerts M. et al., 2016); 6) Fine-tuning the nanobody screening and selection process allows the identification of compounds that recognise target antigens across species (i.e. murine and human antigens) when sufficiently homologous; Cross-reactive nanobodies simplify preclinical and toxicological studies before translation to the clinic (Blykers A. et al., 2016; Broisat A. et al., 2012); 7) The fast pharmacokinetics of radiolabelled nanobodies, especially when used in conjunction with short-lived isotopes, result in a low radiation burden to patients (Keyaerts M. et al., 2016). 

Antigen-specific monovalent nanobodies will be identified by VIB against the lymphocyte activation marker CD69, the M2-macrophage marker CD163 and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) marker CD8. Contrary to the anti-CD8 minibody tracer investigated in WP6 that is targeting the CD8α-chain, which is also expressed on certain myeloid cells (e.g. monocytes and macrophages; Gibbings D.J. et al., 2007), the new anti-CD8 nanobody tracer will target the CD8β-chain that is more selective for lymphocyte subsets. Nanobody development will follow a workflow that starts with immunisation of camelids with recombinant antigens. These proteins will be produced in mammalian expression hosts by Roche and validated for functionality and folding. We aim to generate nanobodies that recognise murine and human antigens with similar high affinities, and we will therefore use recombinant proteins derived from both species during all steps of selection and screening. Of the three targeted membrane proteins, CD8β and CD69 show rather low sequence identity in the extracellular part over the species (resp. 49% and 57%), while the CD163 sequence shows sufficient conservation (>85% sequence identity) to predict successful development of cross-reactive compounds. For CD8β and CD69 nanobodies we anticipate lack of cross reactive binders and therefore we will in WP4 initiate the development of gene-modified mice bearing a knock-in (KI) construct in which the (extracellular portion of the) human gene replaces the murine gene (KI mice). The specificity of human antigen-specific tracers will be determined in WP4 by comparisons of biodistributions in the KI versus wildtype (WT) mice. Likewise, the specificity of cross-reactive nanobodies will be determined in WT versus gene-deficient (KO) mice available at WWU, VIB. 

For all target proteins, immune libraries will be constructed, phage displayed and subjected to biopanning on the antigens, after which a panel of antigen-binders will be identified by ELISA screening and sequencing. Each nanobody panel will be subjected to a 'hit-to-lead' discovery process (supervised by VUB), aiming to select a lead compound with the overall best in vitro and in vivo properties for imaging. In vitro tests will consist of (a) evaluation of production yield, solubility (SEC analysis), stability (ThermoFluor assays), affinity, cross-reactivity and epitope recognition on rodent/human (and monkey, for NHP imaging studies in WP5) recombinant proteins (by surface plasmon resonance); (b) classical flow cytometry analyses and radioligand cell binding studies on purified immune cells and on transfected cell lines that will be developed by Roche to evaluate the specificity of all nanobody constructs; (c) assessment of the absence of immune cell activation and in vitro toxicity. In vitro toxicity assays (conducted by Roche and supported by VIB and UMCG) involve incubation of isolated immune cells, PBMCs, and/or whole blood with purified nanobodies and evaluating cytokine levels by multiplex ELISA, proliferation, and viability, as well as monitoring cell surface activation markers by flow cytometry. Lead nanobodies binding to CD8β, CD69 or CD163 with the highest affinity and stability, lowest potential toxicity, and the best ability to target antigen-positive immune cells in medium-high-throughput in vivo imaging studies in mice in WP4 (Vaneycken I. et al.; 2011) will be selected for development of PET and OI derivatives in Task 3.6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Licence Holder is the University of Oxford and the Designated Individual (DI) is Dr Clare Verrill. The licence covers activities within Oxford, at the main site, the John Radcliffe Hospital, and at the satellite sites, Cowley Store, Churchill Hospital, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre and Department of Pharmacology.     ORB provides infrastructure to underpin biobank activities and delivers a portfolio of integrated services to users, from acquisition, storage and distribution of biospecimens, through to governance, ethical and regulatory cover. The biospecimens and associated information managed by ORB will be used for research studies that may contribute to increasing the knowledge and understanding of disease in order to improve diagnosis and treatment, and could ultimately lead to improvements in patient care.  ORB was established in 2006 when a number of active and legacy collections within the University of Oxford and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust were brought together for licensing by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA). This was in response to new legislation, the Human Tissue Act (2004), which came into effect on 1 September 2006.     ORB acts as a single gateway for access to the many biospecimen collections held in Oxford. Custodians of collections engage with ORB as part of a federated model. A primary focus of ORB is maintenance of a generic, open-access resource of biospecimens donated by patients and research participants for use in medical research and provision of a simple and efficient system to collect, store, curate, and distribute these biospecimens and associated information.   In response to the requirements of the Human Tissue Act, ORB operates a multi-site Human Tissue Authority Research Licence with policies and procedures in place to ensure registered collections comply with the legislation. ORB also provides storage facilities according to HTA guidelines.   It is recognised that access to large numbers of high-quality, clinically annotated biomaterials is vital for the advancement of medical research and healthcare delivery.

Additionally participants can consent for spare blood, left after routine venepuncture to be stored for future research studies.  This has been implemented in tayside and Grampian with over 50,000 blood samples  intercepted by March 2017.    Anyone over the age of 11 years in Scotland can participate.  Participants are approached through a range of methods including directly at out-patient clinics and GP practices, leaflets with hospital letters and personal email from employers.   SHARE has recruited around 150,000 people, with over 95% of all individuals providing consent for the use of spare blood.  SHARE has demonstrated that it can quickly and efficiently recruit to studies. In addition it can be used to administer questionnaire studies by email and recruit to patient and public involvement groups.  SHARE continues to steadily recruit with the ambition of eventually achieving 1,000,000 people in Scotland. We are steadily extending the datasets we use for identifying participants.

The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.    A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.    Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.    The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality    The WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.",parry-jonesa@cf.ac.uk,Biobank,,,,,,,,,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the exclusive targeting of mitogenic mechanisms has shown two crucial limitations: the emergence of chemo-resistance within target cells and evasion promoted by tumor heterogeneity. In this context, the researchers and clinicians involved in this project share the will to focus their studies on intrinsic and extrinsic determinants that allow pre-cancer and cancer cells to escape from onco-suppressive barriers (apoptosis, senescence, interactions with the immune system and the microenvironment), with the aim to develop innovative therapeutic approaches designed to specifically target cancerous cell survival processes. The foundations of this project can thus be found in the scientific links that have been forged over the past few years between the diverse INSERM and CNRS units present on the site (INSERM Unit 590, UMR CNRS 5238, UMR CNRS 5201, INSERM Unit 865, and INSERM Unit 871), in the framework of this restricted but promising aspect of cancer research. Hence, above and beyond cancer research that unifies the different groups, the members of these various laboratories have expressed the will to define and develop common priority research themes:-The study of mechanisms of tumoral escape. The aim of this research axis, within the framework of specific tumor types (breast cancers, intestinal tumors, pancreatic tumors, virally-induced hepatic tumors, sarcomas, neuroblastomas, hematological malignancies), is to identify the mechanisms that allow cancerous cells to evade the intrinsic safeguard responses of the cell. It comprises three sub-themes with numerous interrelations both in conceptual terms and in terms of applied research:osub-theme 1 is the characterization of mechanisms allowing cancers to avoid intrinsic onco suppressive processes (senescence and apoptosis);osub theme 2 is the analysis of mechanisms of avoiding immuno surveillance;osub-theme 3 is the pre-clinical evaluation that the re-engagement of these safeguard mechanisms can be promising therapeutic approaches. The long-term objective is to improve understanding of the involvement of these mechanisms in the processes of tumor progression, metastasis and chemo-resistance, so as to be able to propose innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring these safety systems and identifying new diagnostic and predictive factors. -Analysis of the perversion of information flow by the carcinogenic process. In multi-cellular organisms, the continuous integration of signals from the microenvironment by normal cells requires the onset of specific genetic programs which express information stored in the hereditary material and, through transcription and translation, transfer this information to the effector molecules. At each step, major and multiple differences between normal and cancer cells are evidenced. The objective of this research theme is the identification of those differences that may be instrumental in determining the phenotypic divergence between normal and malignant states. These programs are recognized as being innovative and involving collaboration between groups. As such they form part of the priority research approaches cancer cluster CLARA (Canceropole Lyon-Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne). The approach ""Tumoral Escape"" forms the core of the research program of the Fondation de Cooperation Scientifique ""Synergie Lyon Cancer"" (Scientific Cooperation Foundation ""Lyon Cancer Synergy"") created in 2007 following the nationwide call for proposals from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, in order to create the Reseau Thematique de Recherche et de Soins (RTRS) (Thematic Network Research and Care). Furthermore, the work on the role of immunosurveillance as well as the analysis of virally induced cancers are developed within the framework of the scientific priorities of the Fondation ""Innovations en Infectiologie"" (FINOVI) and the Lyon Biopole, thereby creating close links between research themes of the sites of Lyon-Est and Lyon Sud-Gerland.",severine.tabone-eglinger@lyon.unicancer.fr,Biobank,,,,,,,,,,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QUOD - Quality in Organ Donation,21.12110/1.9488-AC50-3473,,QUOD - Quality in Organ Donation,,,http://www.quod.org.uk/,,,"Organ donation and transplant saves thousands of lives a year and could be considered one of the greatest successes in modern medicine. However, over the past decade, there has been an ever increasing need for organs throughout the UK, far surpassing the supply. This is a pattern that is predicted to worsen over the next 10 years.    As many as one in three patients on the transplant waiting list will die or become too unwell to receive a transplant as a result of this disparity.     To address this problem, the transplant community have been turning to organs previously considered to be unsuitable for transplantation, including organs from extended criteria donors and non-heart beating donors. In order to do this, QUOD aims to facilitate research by collecting blood, urine and tissue samples of appropriately consented / authorised organ donors. Through this, it may be possible to determine pathways of injury and repair in organs and identify biomarkers which can be used to better predict the outcomes of transplantation.    QUOD is a nationwide programme encompassing all retrieval zones in the UK. These regions include:     •Birmingham / Cardiff  •Cambridge  •Edinburgh  •London Kings  •Manchester / Leeds  •Newcastle  •Oxford / Royal Free    The QUOD team has a wide range of personnel, including specialist nurses, transplant surgeons, academics, management teams and a variety of healthcare professionals.

Tissue markers of tumour response, circulating markers of angiogenesis, and changes in circulating endothelial cells/precursor cells in response to cediranib will be explored.  Thirty six patients with progressive, metastatic, histologically confirmed ASPS will be recruited. Patients will be randomised to 24 weeks of blinded cediranib or placebo, after which treatment will be unblinded and all patients offered open-label cediranib until objective disease progression, or death if sooner.",casps-icrctsu@icr.ac.uk,Biobank,,,,,,,,,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sera submitted to the SEU are residues of specimens submitted for diagnostic testing.  They sample the population range and are anonymised prior to archiving (retaining age, sex, date of collection and source laboratory only). Collection of sera is continuing through collaboration with the PHE Microbiology Services Division (MSD) and some NHS laboratories throughout England, and has occurred annually since 1986.  Over 230,000 sera are now stored and catalogued.
