ii) Previously normal blood pressures
iii) No protein in the urine
iv) No manifestations of preeclampsia

Defined using the WHO foetal growth charts (Kiserud et al 2017) using the 5th and 95th percentiles as cut-off values for SGA and LGA respectively .
Tables 14 and 15 are the reference tables for females and males (respectively) born <40 completed weeks.
Table 4 is the reference table for females and males born >= 40 completed weeks.
A child is classified as SGA if their birth weight is <= 5th percentile for their gestational age (in completed weeks).
A child is classified as LGA if their birth weight is >= 95th percentile for their gestational age (in completed weeks).
For e.g., a female born at 32 weeks + 2 days weighing 1,530g will be classified as SGA.

Conjoined twins have a specific ICD/BPA code, to be coded under “syndrome” (variable 27). Give full description of type of conjoined twinning in syndrome text field (variables 28).

Any other malformations are coded in variables 29-44.

The purpose of this coding system is to allow us to distinguish malformed cases which would have civil registration as singleton births from malformed cases which would have civil registration as multiple births.

OOM,EUROCAT,firsttri,,,,,"FIRST TRIMESTER MEDICATION
“Yes” means that the data sources clearly state that medication was taken in the first trimester. “No” means that the data sources clearly state that no medication was taken in the first trimester.
“Undetermined” means that the usual data sources were consulted, but
 it was not clearly stated that medication was either taken or not taken
 the information regarding medication use was illegible
 Type of medication is unknown.
“Medication taken but timing unknown” means that the usual data sources stated that medication was taken but the timing of use was not stated for some or all of the medications.
Use this option also for cases in which the data sources clearly state that certain medication was taken in the first trimester, but for other medication the timing was unknown. Use SP_DRUGS fields to explain for each recorded medication whether it was taken in the first trimester, or if timing was unknown.
“Not Known” means that the usual data sources were not found.
Only fill in DRUGS1-5 and EXTRADRUGS if you have coded FIRSTTRI = 1 (Yes medication taken) or = 4 (Medication taken, but timing unknown).
If you have coded FIRSTTRI = 2 (no medication taken), FIRSTTRI = 3 (undetermined) or FIRSTTRI = 9 (unknown), there shouldn’t be any ATC codes in any of the DRUGS variables
 Include any medication that was taken by the mother during the first trimester of pregnancy (from the 1st day of the last menstrual period up to the 12th week of gestation). Medication with long elimination half time and taken before conception should be included (eg. Acitretin, Etretinate, etc.).
 Use of folic acid (either as folic acid only tablets or a multivitamin preparation which contains folic acid) should be registered in the folic acid variable
 Do not include usual vitamins and mineral supplementation, but include unusual intakes of vitamins or minerals (eg. Vitamin A mega doses).
 Only medication taken at physiologic doses should be included.
Whilst FIRSTTRI is a new variable in Guide 1.4 (for cases born from 2013 onwards) if any registry has this information for previous cases, EUROCAT is interested in collecting this information from 2005 onwards",,,,2.2,,,,,,,,,"1 = Yes,medication taken in first trimester

Include mother herself as well as mother’s family. Specify type of anomaly in written text and relation to the infant.

If the aetiology is unknown or multifactorial, “same” is a matter of judgment by a qualified coder, but full specification of the anomaly should be given, whether other or the same.

“Same and other” refers to two different relatives. If a relative has both the same and another anomaly, code “same”.

When each anomaly was first diagnosed.
The basis for this variable is to record whether the prenatal findings strongly suggest the postnatal diagnosis. This variable is not designed for fetal medicine specialists to assess the accuracy of their prenatal diagnosis. Thus the finding of a significant heart anomaly prenatally is considered to be prenatally detected, even if the exact anomaly was not correctly diagnosed. ‘Yes, prenatally diagnosed’, should be used when the prenatal finding is nearly 100% predictive of the congenital anomaly. ‘Partially’ means that the prenatal finding is consistent with the postnatal anomaly but has a lesser predictive value, being suggestive of more than one type of anomaly, an example here would be increased nuchal translucency. The examples below are to illustrate this principle and ensure consistency of coding. Queries about individual cases can be send to Central registry",,,,2.2,,,,,,,,,"1 = Yes,this anomaly was diagnosed prenatally

OOM,EUROCAT,type,,,,,"TYPE OF BIRTH
Birth with type of birth not known should be transmitted to EUROCAT, but will be excluded from routine EUROCAT analysis.

EUROCAT includes all livebirths, fetal deaths with gestational age (GA) ≥20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy (at any gestational age) after prenatal diagnosis of malformation. Fetal deaths with GA < 20 weeks (code =
3) may be reported to EUROCAT but will not be included in prevalence data.

The distinction between stillbirth and spontaneous abortion should follow the definitions in use in your country (to be specified in your Registry Description). There is usually a lower gestational age limit or birthweight limit for stillbirths. This varies from country to country. Below this limit fetal deaths are called spontaneous abortions.

Terminations of pregnancy refer to cases where prenatal diagnosis was made of malformation in a live fetus and the pregnancy was then terminated. If the fetus died spontaneously in utero either before or after prenatal diagnosis of malformation then it should be coded as spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, not as termination of pregnancy. If a termination was performed for other reasons than malformation, the case should not be transmitted to Central Registry. This means that early terminations where there was no suspicion of malformation before termination should be excluded from the case files.

Stillbirths or perinatal deaths resulting from termination of pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis must be coded as terminations (value = 4), irrespective of civil registration status.

For a non-natural fetal reduction in a multiple pregnancy where one fetus is malformed, code 4 (in that case gestlength = gestational age at reduction; date of birth = date of reduction; and code carefully all multiple birth

For livebirths: when first suspicion malformation was at death OR at postmortem, when discovered is age at death (eg. At birth, < 1 week, 1-4 weeks etc).

For stillbirths: when first suspicion of a malformation was at birth OR at postmortem, when discovered is at birth (eg.
Code = 1).

All cases MUST have been confirmed as having a congenital anomaly
