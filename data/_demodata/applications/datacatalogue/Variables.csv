In PROGRs (PSYCONN): 
Most of the time the ‘GENDER’ variable will be biological sex. If a patient is transitioning from sex, the patient is asked to change their personal information in their medical file. If the patient mentions that their gender does not correspond with what is stated in their medical file, first an agreement has to be made about this between the patient and the care provider. 
It was decided to harmonize the PROGRs variable as sex instead of gender, because there was insufficient overlap between the cohorts to make a distinction between sex and gender. If possible, reconsider this when adding other cohorts. Also include both sex and gender, and non-binary categories in future research.",,,Sex/gender,,

PROGRs (PSYCONN): there are 2 variables that can be used for the GAF: GAF and DSMIV_5. GAF is based on the GAF score from the registration of the “DBC” (care path, basis of Dutch hospital care finance). DSMIV_5 is scored by research nurses specifically for PROGRs. The DSMIV_5 therefore seems more reliable. The GAF is used in case the DSMIV_5 variable was missing. This has been adjusted in the pre-processing phase.

pstadium: Het pathologisch (post-chirurgisch) stadium wordt gebaseerd op de pT, de pN en de cM/pM. Ook in het geval van prechirurgische therapie is er gekeken naar de pT en de pN (de ypT en ypN in dat geval). Wanneer er na prechirurgische therapie geen tumor meer aantoonbaar is wordt dit weergegeven als stadiump=0.

Betekenis “X” (onbekend): Het juiste stadium kan niet berekend worden, bijvoorbeeld bij TX/NX/M0. Betekenis “M” (missing): Een M wordt weergegeven als er geen TNM is ingevuld. Dit kan het geval zijn als de registratie nog niet volledig is afgerond, of er kan gebruik gemaakt zijn van de EoD-stadiëring in plaats van de TNM-stadiëring. Betekenis stadium “NVT” (niet van toepassing): TNM-stadium is niet van toepassing voor de betreffende tumorsoort in deze incidentieperiode.",,,,,

It can be seen that the miscarriages have been classified according to the gestation at which the miscarriage took place. For 18 pregnancieswhatever reason. However  fetuses that died in utero but for whom labour had to be induced are coded as miscarriages. It can be seen that the miscarriages have been classified according to the gestation at which the miscarriage took place. For 18 pregnancies  there was no reliable information that allowed us to estimate the gestation at miscarriage and these are coded as miscarriage gestation not known. Terminations were classified according to whether they were for a congenital malformation (code 6) or other reasons (code 7). Note that women intending to have a termination for social reasons were unlikely to take part in the study. There was a miscellaneous group of 9 pregnancies with outcomes before 20 weeks that did not conform to the definition of either a miscarriage or termination - and these are coded separately (code 8). They include ectopic pregnancies and hydatidiform moles.,,,,,
