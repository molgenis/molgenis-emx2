It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes. Recruitment sought to enroll pregnant women in the Bristol area of the UK during 1990-92; this was extended to include additional children eligible using the original enrollment definition up to the age of 18 years. The children from 14541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990-92, increasing to 15247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks-18 years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7-17 years of age). The resource comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological samples, genetic (DNA on 11343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children, complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000 children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date, over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data."

The cohorts investigated the association of early life exposures and a wide range of non-communicable diseases.

Objective: The objective is to report the research methodology, with emphasis on the advantages and limitations offered by an Internet-based design. These studies were conducted in Turin, Italy and Wellington, New Zealand.

Methods: The cohorts utilized various online/offline methods to recruit participants. Pregnant women who became aware volunteered, completed an online questionnaire, thus obtaining baseline information.

Results: The NINFEA study has recruited 7003 pregnant women, while the ELF study has recruited 2197 women. The cohorts targeted the whole country, utilizing a range of support processes to reduce the attrition rate of the participants. For the NINFEA and ELF cohorts, online participants were predominantly older (35% and 28.9%, respectively), highly educated (55.6% and 84.9%, respectively), and were in their final trimester of pregnancy (48.5% and 53.6%, respectively).

Conclusions: Internet-based cohort epidemiological studies are feasible, however, it is clear that participants are self-selective samples, as is the case for many birth cohorts. Internet-based cohort studies are potentially cost-effective and novel methodology for conducting long-term epidemiology research. However, from our experience, participants tend to be self-selective. In marked time, if the cohorts are to form part of a larger research program they require further use and exploration to address biases and overcome limitations."

Methods: Altogether 131 subjects (40-70 y, BMI 26-39 kg/m(2)) with impaired glucose metabolism and features of the metabolic syndrome were randomized into three groups with 12-week periods according to a parallel study design. They consumed either: a) wholegrain and low postprandial insulin response grain products, fatty fish 3 times a week, and bilberries 3 portions per day (HealthyDiet), b) wholegrain and low postprandial insulin response grain products (WGED), or c) refined wheat breads as cereal products (Control). Altogether 106 subjects completed the study. Serum metabolic profile was studied using an NMR-based platform providing information on lipoprotein subclasses and lipids as well as low-molecular-weight metabolites.

Results: There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the groups at baseline or at the end of the intervention. Mixed model analyses revealed significant changes in lipid metabolites in the HealthyDiet group during the intervention compared to the Control group. All changes reflected increased polyunsaturation in plasma fatty acids, especially in n-3 PUFAs, while n-6 and n-7 fatty acids decreased. According to tertiles of changes in fish intake, a greater increase of fish intake was associated with increased concentration of large HDL particles, larger average diameter of HDL particles, and increased concentrations of large HDL lipid components, even though total levels of HDL cholesterol remained stable.

Conclusions: The results suggest that consumption of diet rich in whole grain, bilberries and especially fatty fish causes changes in HDL particles shifting their subclass distribution toward larger particles. These changes may be related to known protective functions of HDL such as reverse cholesterol transport and could partly explain the known protective effects of fish consumption against atherosclerosis.

Trial registration: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00573781."

Protein intake was associated with more rapid weight gain during infancy         a known risk factor for later obesity.

Objective: We tested whether the reduction of protein in infant formula reduces body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) and the prevalence of obesity at 6 y of age.

Design: The Childhood Obesity Project was conducted as a European multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial that enrolled healthy infants born between October 2002 and July 2004. Formula-fed infants (n = 1090) were randomly assigned to receive higher protein (HP)          or lower protein (LP)         content formula (within recommended amounts) in the first year of life; breastfed infants (n = 588) were enrolled as an observational reference group. We measured the weight and height of 448 (41%) formula-fed children at 6 y of age. BMI was the primary outcome.

Results:; P = 0.009) at 6 y of age. The risk of becoming obese in the HP group was 2.43 (95% CI: 1.12, 5.27; P = 0.024) times that in the LP group. There was a tendency for a higher weight in HP children (0.67 kg; 95% CI: -0.04, 1.39 kg; P = 0.064) but no difference in height between the intervention groups. Anthropometric measurements were similar in the LP and breastfed groups.

Conclusions: Infant formula with a lower protein content reduces BMI and obesity risk at school age. Avoidance of infant foods that provide excessive protein intakes could contribute to a reduction in childhood obesity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00338689."

Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind European trial, healthy infants (N = 1,090) were randomly assigned to different protein content formulas (upper [HP] and lower [LP] limits of the European Union regulations in 2001) during the first year; breastfed infants (N = 588) were recruited for reference values. Weight, height, and triceps and subscapular skinfold (SF) thickness were measured repeatedly (N = 650 at 6 years), and body composition was estimated (Slaughter). The 99th percentile of fat mass index reference data were used to assess excess body fat at 6 years.

Results: At 2 and 6 years, the study observed greater sum of SFs (       2 years: 0.5 mm, P = 0.026,        6 years: 0.6 mm, P = 0.045), fat mass index (       2 years: 0.12 kg/m      , P = 0.008,     :7 kg/m      , P = 0.003,        6 years: 0.18 kg/m      , P = 0.010) in the HP group compared with the LP group. At 6 years, the HP group had a twofold higher risk than the LP group for excess body fat (adjusted odds ratio: 2.13, P = 0.019).

Conclusions: Infant formula with HP levels induced greater fat mass in children from 2 to 6 years. Lowering the protein content of infant formula may result in a healthier body composition in early childhood.

There is a corresponding lack of evidence to guide development of culturally-appropriate, obesity prevention programmes.  This paper describes the methodology and characteristics of participants in Born in Bradford 1000 (BiB1000), a nested cohort of the Born in Bradford prospective birth cohort.  BiB1000 aims to enable a deep and extensive understanding of the predictors and influences of health-related behaviours to develop a culturally-specific obesity prevention intervention.  1,735 mothers agreed to take part in detailed assessments focused on risk factors of obesity. Of these, 1,707 had singleton births. Data were collected from the families during pregnancy, at birth and when the infant was aged 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months.  Approximately half of the mothers (n=933) are of South Asian ethnicity; of which, just under half were born in the UK.  Prevalence of obesity in BiB1000 is similar to the full BiB cohort and to UK national averages.   In addition to pre-specified hypothesised targets for obesity prevention, (e.g. parental feeding styles, diet and activity), BiB1000 is exploring qualitative determinants of behaviours andother exposures with a lesser evidence base (e.g. food environments, sleep, parenting practices).  These data will enable a rich understanding of the behaviours and their determinants in order to inform the development of a culturally-relevant, childhood obesity prevention intervention."

Infant mortality is highest for babies of Pakistani origin, who comprise almost half the babies born in Bradford. The Born in Bradford cohort study aims to examine environmental, psychological and genetic factors that impact on health and development perinatally, during childhood and subsequent adult life, and those that influence their parents' health and wellbeing. This protocol outlines methods for the recruitment phase of the study.

Methods: Most Bradford women attend for antenatal care and give birth at the Bradford Royal Infirmary, which has approximately 5,800 births per year. Women are eligible for recruitment if they plan to give birth here. Babies born from March 2007 are eligible to participate, recruitment is planned to continue until 2010. Fathers of babies recruited are invited to participate. Women are usually recruited when they attend for a routine oral glucose tolerance test at 26-28 weeks gestation. Recruitment of babies is at birth. Fathers are recruited whenever possible during the antenatal period, or soon after the birth. The aim is to recruit 10,000 women, their babies, and the babies' fathers. At recruitment women have blood samples taken, are interviewed to complete a semi-structured questionnaire, weighed, and have height, arm circumference and triceps skinfold measured. Umbilical cord blood is collected at birth. Within two weeks of birth babies have their head, arm and abdominal circumference measured, along with subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness. Fathers self-complete a questionnaire at recruitment, have height and weight measured, and provide a saliva sample. Participants are allocated a unique study number. NHS numbers will be used to facilitate record linkage and access to routine data. A wide range of hospital and community sources is being accessed to provide data for the women and children. Data are checked for accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion: Born in Bradford will increase understanding of the factors that contribute to health and wellbeing, and identify factors that influence differences in them between people of Pakistani and European origin."

We have previously shown that people who were exposed to famine during early gestation performed worse on a selective attention task, which may be a first sign of cognitive decline, and were on average 3         years younger at the time of coronary artery disease diagnosis. Women in this group seem to die at a younger age. We hypothesise that an accelerated ageing process, set in motion by the poor prenatal environment, underlies these findings.

Methods and analysis The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort consists of 2414 men and women born in Amsterdam as term singletons around the time of the Dutch famine. In a subsample of 150 cohort members, who now are about 68         years of age, we are currently measuring cognitive decline and the incidence of white matter hyperintensities and cerebral microbleeds (throand physical performance, visual acuity and incidence of cataract operations. In this same subgroup, we will assess telomere length, oxidative stress and inflammatory status as potential underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, in the entire cohort, we will assess mortality as well as hospital admissions for age-related diseases up to the age of 68 years.

Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the local medical ethics committee (Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam) and is being carried out in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants give written informed consent. Study findings will be widely disseminated to the scientific public as well as to the medical society and general public."

A follow-up assessment was completed 17-18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on >10000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available. Details of how to access these data are provided in this cohort profile."

Herein we investigated the effects of low-insulin-response grain products, fatty fish, and berries on glucose metabolism and plasma lipidomic profiles in persons with impaired glucose metabolism.

Methodology/principal findings: Altogether 106 men and women with impaired glucose metabolism and with at least two other features of the metabolic syndrome were included in a 12-week parallel dietary intervention. The participants were randomized into three diet intervention groups: (1) whole grain and low postprandial insulin response grain products, fatty fish three times a week, and bilberries three portions per day (HealthyDiet group), (2) Whole grain enriched diet (WGED) group, which includes principally the same grain products as group (1), but with no change in fish or berry consumption, and (3) refined wheat breads (Control). Oral glucose tolerance, plasma fatty acids and lipidomic profiles were measured before and after the intervention. Self-reported compliance with the diets was good and the body weight remained constant. Within the HealthyDiet group two hour glucose concentration and area-under-the-curve for glucose decreased and plasma proportion of (n-3) long-chain PUFAs increased (False Discovery Rate p-values <0.05). Increases in eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid associated curvilinearly with the improved insulin secretion and glucose disposal. Among the 364 characterized lipids, 25 changed significantly in the HealthyDiet group, including multiple triglycerides incorporating the long chain (n-3) PUFA.

Conclusions/significance: The results suggest that the diet rich in whole grain and low insulin response grain products, bilberries, and fatty fish improve glucose metabolism and alter the lipidomic profile. Therefore, such a diet may have a beneficial effect in the efforts to prevent type 2 diabetes in high risk persons.

The aim of the study is to investigate determinants of disease occurrence and progression in the elderly. In addition to contributing to our understanding of the etiology of geriatric illnesses, the study is expected to lead to specific recommendations for intervention. The study focuses on causally related determinants of major diseases in the elderly. Fields of interest for the Rotterdam Elderly Study are conditions which interfere the most with the quality of life for the elderly. The aims of the Rotterdam Elderly Study are: (1) To investigate, by means of epidemiologic, clinical and basic research, the determinants of diseases in order to assess their etiologic significance. (2) To investigate potentially modifiable determinants in order to be able to develop preventive strategies by providing specific recommendations for intervention studies. The Rotterdam Elderly Study focuses on four primary areas of research: neurogeriatric diseases, cardiovascular diseases, locomotor diseases and ophthalmologic diseases. It is a prospective follow-up study, in which determinants of disease and determinants of progression of disease will be investigated in the total population of 55 years or over of the district of Ommoord in Rotterdam. It is anticipated that about 10,000 people will participate in the study and they will be examined in the period of 1991 to 1995."

The study area comprises three large areas defined by latitude: Northern Lapland (NL), Southern Lapland (SL) and Oulu province (OP), comprising 74 localities with a total study population of 9216 singleton births. The mean birthweight was 3482 g for NL, 3537 g for SL and 3587 g for OP (NL vs. OP and SL vs. OP: P < 0.05). The crude rate for stillbirths was highest in NL. The women in the northernmost area were socially less privileged and the localities less prosperous compared with those in the southernmost area. Significant spatial clustering of mean birthweights was found (P = 0.0016), with highest birthweight in the south-western part of the study area. A variable expressing the wealth of each locality, the financial capacity category (FCC), had its lowest mean value in NL, with a range of one to six for the localities studied here. A multilevel multiple regression model showed that, after allowing for sex, gestational age, mother's age, height and hypertensive disorders, parity, body mass index, previous low birthweight child and smoking as individual determinants of birthweight, part of the residual variation could be explained by the locality wealth parameter. Using the multilevel model, the differences in mean birthweight across the three latitude areas persisted but were reduced (difference OP vs. NL reduced from 105 g to 86.5 g). The relationship between birthweight and FCC was inverse U-shaped with the highest mean birthweight estimated for localities occurring in the middle of the range (FCC = 3). The wealthiest urban localities (FCC = 6) and the most deprived localities (FCC = 1) both had a predicted birthweight about 60 g below the maximum at FCC = 3, if all other factors were held constant. This result, taken together with the spatial clustering of birthweights, suggests that there may be important social and environmental determinants of birthweight that have yet to be identified."

Design: A prospective 1 year birth cohort.

Setting: Maternity hospitals in the two northernmost administrative provinces of Finland, including one university hospital and three central hospitals, three local hospitals and five health centres.

Subjects: Eight thousand six hundred and six singleton pregnancies, including 1679 with induced labour.

Main outcome measure: Data collection on age, parity, social factors and education at antenatal clinic. Data on labour collected from the hospital records after delivery.

Results: Labour was induced significantly more often at units of the lowest level of specialisation, the health centres (29.4%) than at the local hospitals (23.6%, P < 0.003) or in the most specialised central hospitals (17.7%, P < 0.0001). Cases of induced labour accumulated on working days. Indicative reasons, such as maternal or fetal conditions, comprised 45.0% of the indications for induction, the most common causes being elective reasons, e.g. timing of labour (51.3%). The risk of elective induction was 2.6 times greater at the primary care level than at the central hospitals (95% confidence limit, CL 2.0-3.2). The corresponding risk ratio for local hospitals was 1.8 (CL 1.5-2.1). The risk of caesarean section was 1.5 times greater in the elective induction group than in the spontaneous group (CL 1.1-1.9) and 2.9 times greater in the indicative induction group. The most common indication for caesarean section was dysfunctional, arrested labour, causes such as fetal asphyxia or antenatal haemorrhage were not seen in excess.

Conclusion: The practice of induction of labour are not consistent in different hospitals. The opinions of individual practitioners and staff routines influence the induction policy nearly as much as do medical reasons. Despite the safety of induction, a liberal induction policy leads to an increase in operative deliveries creating potential risks for the mother and child and greater expense."

We therefore investigated the associations of four dietary quality indices with cardiometabolic risk score and cardiometabolic risk factors in Finnish children.

Methods and results: Subjects were a population sample of 204 boys and 198 girls aged 6-8 years. We assessed diet by 4-day food records and calculated Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Score, Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index (FCHEI). We calculated the age- and sex-adjusted cardiometabolic risk score summing up Z-scores for waist circumference, mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and concentrations of fasting serum insulin and fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, the last multiplying by -1. Higher FCHEI was associated with lower cardiometabolic risk score among boys (standardised regression coefficient        = -0.14, P = 0.044) adjusted for age, physical activity, electronic media time and household income. Higher DASH Score was related to a lower serum insulin in boys (       = -0.15, P = 0.028). Higher DASH Score (       = -0.16, P = 0.023) and FCHEI (       = -0.17, P = 0.014) were related to lower triglyceride concentration in boys. Higher FCHEI was associated with lower triglyceride concentration in girls (       = -0.16, P = 0.033). Higher DASH Score (       = -0.19, P = 0.011) and BSDS (       = -0.23, P = 0.001) were associated with lower plasma HDL cholesterol concentration in girls.

Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of wholegrain rye intake on circulating metabolites in a human intervention study using untargeted metabolomics.

Methods: The intervention consisted of 2 successive 4-wk periods in a randomized crossover design, where 15 adults consumed wholegrain rye bread (WGR) or white wheat bread enriched with fermented rye bran (WW+RB), following a 4-wk rye-free period with white wheat bread (WW). Fasting plasma samples were collected at the end of each period and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolic profiles were compared to identify compounds discriminating WGR from the WW+RB and WW periods. Because peripheral serotonin is produced mainly in the gut, a hypothesis of its altered biosynthesis as a response to increased cereal fiber intake was tested by measuring intestinal serotonin of mice fed for 9 wk on a high-fat diet supplemented with different sources of fiber (rye bran flour, ground wheat aleurone, or powdered cellulose).

Results: Five endogenous metabolites and 15 rye phytochemicals associated with WGR intake were identified. Plasma concentrations of serotonin, taurine, and glycerophosphocholine were significantly lower after the WGR than WW period (Q < 0.05). Concentrations of 2 phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens, PE(18:2/P-18:0) and PE(18:2/P-16:0), were lower after the WGR period than the WW+RB period (Q < 0.05). The concentration of serotonin was significantly lower in the colonic tissue of mice that consumed rye bran or wheat aleurone compared with cellulose (P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Wholegrain rye intake decreases plasma serotonin in healthy adults when compared with refined wheat. Intake of rye bran and wheat aleurone decreases colonic serotonin in mice. These results suggest that peripheral serotonin could be a potential link between wholegrain consumption and its associated health effects.Data used in the study were derived from a trial registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03550365.

Born in Bradford (BiB) is a prospective multi-ethnic pregnancy and birth cohort study that was established to examine determinants of health and development during childhood and, subsequently, adult life in a deprived multi-ethnic population in the north of England. Between 2007 and 2010, the BiB cohort recruited 12,453 women who experienced 13,776 pregnancies and 13,858 births, along with 3353 of their partners. Forty five percent of the cohort are of Pakistani origin. Now that children are at primary school, the first full follow-up of the cohort is taking place. The aims of the follow-up are to investigate the determinants of children         s pre-pubertal health and development, including through understanding parents          health and wellbeing, and to obtain data on exposures in childhood that might influence future health.

Methods
We are employing a multi-method approach across three data collection arms (community-based family visits, school based phy motor function and wellbeing measures) to follow-up over 9000 BiB children aged 7         11         years and their families between 2017 and 2021. We are collecting detailed parent and child questionnaires, cognitive and sensorimotor assessments, blood pressure, anthropometry and blood samples from parents and children. Dual x-ray absorptiometry body scans, accelerometry and urine samples are collected on subsamples. Informed consent is collected for continued routine data linkage to health, social care and education records. A range of engagement activities are being used to raise the profile of BiB and to disseminate findings.

Discussion
