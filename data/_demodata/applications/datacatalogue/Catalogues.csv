LifeCycle,project,MOLGENIS,LifeCycle,"A Europe-wide network of cohort studies started in early life Cohort studies started from pregnancy or childhood give the unique opportunity to relate early-life stressors with variation in development, health and disease throughout the life course. Moreover, advanced analytical approaches used in observational studies can help identify causality and potential for early-life interventions on factors that cannot be easily studied in experimental settings.",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.rdf,https://specs.fairdatapoint.org/fdp-specs-v1.2.html
ATHLETE,project,MOLGENIS,ATHLETE,"Children are particularly vulnerable to environmental hazards. The ATHLETE project will measure a wide range of environmental exposures (urban, chemical, lifestyle and social risk factors) during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. The project will then link this “early-life exposome” to children’s biological responses and cardiometabolic, respiratory, and mental health. The results will help us to better understand and prevent health damage from environmental agents from the earliest parts of the life course onward.",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.rdf,https://specs.fairdatapoint.org/fdp-specs-v1.2.html
IPEC,theme,MOLGENIS,IPEC,"There are many early psychosis cohorts in the world. Epidemiological research with these cohorts over the past decades has greatly increased the understanding of distribution and mechanisms of psychotic disorders. Carrying out cross-country comparisons on a larger scale is extremely costly. An alternative strategy is to pool the existing large amount of data from high-quality early psychosis studies at an individual patient level. This approach has multiple advantages: it allows for examining psychosis determinants with greater precision, also including rare exposures and outcomes, focusing on (long-term) follow-up, and making optimal use of already existing data. To achieve this, the International Psychosis Epidemiology Consortium (IPEC) has catalogued and harmonized data from early psychosis cohorts and set up a virtual databank. With this databank, multiple (epidemiological) studies within the scope of the following research question will be conducted: “What drives the course of functional, existential and clinical outcomes of (early) psychosis and how does the social and geographical context shape these patterns?”",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.rdf,https://specs.fairdatapoint.org/fdp-specs-v1.2.html
