BIB,,Born in Bradford,,BIB,Cohort study,,Birth cohort,,,,https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/,"Born in Bradford (BiB) started in 2007 as a response to the poor health outcomes for children in Bradford. Pregnant women were recruited when they attended the Bradford Royal Infirmary for their routine maternity care. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about different aspects of their lives including demographics information, physical and mental health and socio-economic information.

Between 2007 and 2011, 12,453 pregnant women were recruited and 3,353 of their partners. Participants also gave permission for routine data linkage for themselves and their children. The BiB cohort is split between approximately 50% South Asian and 50% non-South Asian participants.

BiB has completed a number of sub-sample studies including BiB1000, which focused on exploring ethnic variation and risk factors of childhood obesity. Data collection included questionnaires with parents when the children were between 6 and 36 months at 6 monthly intervals.The ALLIN and MeDALL studies focused on the relationships between childhood allergies and infections. Data collection for these studies were done via a questionnaire and, for the MeDALL study, children were asked to have a skin allergy test.

Since 2016, BiB have undertaken a full cohort follow-up compromising of home visits for data collection through questionnaires, school visits where children carried out cognitive assessments, and a child measurement programme where children were weighed and measured, had their activity levels measured, and were asked to give a blood sample.

From the findings of these studies, BiB have developed a range of additional research projects such as evaluating and developing new interventions to improve health; for example, focusing on reducing childhood obesity, increasing physical activity, improving oral health and improving mental wellbeing. BiB have gone beyond functioning as an observational birth cohort and are actively trying to build and strengthen local research capacity and translate evidence to practice.",Multicultural,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Retrospective,Prospective",,,,,,12453,,,,,,Bradford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,general research use,return to database or resource,"Born in Bradford allows researchers to apply to access the study data through the BiB Executive Group.

Data on the individuals born into this cohort was collected since the 24th gestational week as well as their mothers and, to a lesser extent, fathers. The cohort included 12055 mothers and they had 12068 deliveries (13 women delivered twice).

Cases belonging to survey were determined by the calculated term. A small percentage of the births occurred towards the end of 1965 and early in 1967. The calculated term, as was customary at that time, was counted from the first day of the last menstrual period. Where this date was unknown the expected term was estimated from the  date of commencement of foetal ovements and progress of the pregnancy. The study covered all live born and stillborn infants with birth weight of 600 grams or more.

According to the Finland's central Office of Statistics, births in the study area during 1966 totalled 12527, so study population comprised 96.3 per cent of all births during 1966 in that area. Altogether 12231 children were born into the cohort, 12058 of them live born.

 Pregnant women with an expected delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006 living in Rotterdam were eligible for participation in the study. In total, 9778 mothers were enrolled in the study, who gave birth to 9749 live born children. Extensive assessments are performed in mothers, fathers and their children. Measurements were planned in early pregnancy (gestational age <18 weeks), mid pregnancy (gestational age 18–25 weeks) and late pregnancy (gestational age >25 weeks). The fathers were assessed once during the pregnancy of their partner. The children form a prenatally recruited birth cohort that will be followed at least until young adulthood. In the preschool period, which in the Netherlands refers to the period from birth until the age of 4 years, data collection was performed by a home-visit at the age of 3 months, and by repeated questionnaires and routine child health centers visits. Information from these routine visitobtained and used for the study. Additional detailed measurements of fetal and postnatal growth and development were conducted in a randomly selected subgroup of Dutch children and their parents at a gestational age of 32 weeks and postnatally at the ages of 1.5, 6, 14, 24, 36 and 48 months in a dedicated research center.
 
Around the ages of 6 and 10 years all children and their parents were invited to visit our research center in the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children’s Hospital to participate in hands-on measurements, advanced imaging modalities, behavioural observations and biological sample collection. MRI scans of all participating children were made in order to image abdominal composition, brain, lungs, cardiovascular system, fat tissue, kidney, liver, and hip development. Furthermore, the parents received 6 questionnaires during this period. Children also received their own questionnaire around the age of 10.

Epidemiological research with these cohorts over the past decades has greatly increased the understanding of distribution and mechanisms of psychotic disorders. Carrying out cross-country comparisons on a larger scale is extremely costly. An alternative strategy is to pool the existing large amount of data from high-quality early psychosis studies at an individual patient level. This approach has multiple advantages: it allows for examining psychosis determinants with greater precision, also including rare exposures and outcomes, focusing on (long-term) follow-up, and making optimal use of already existing data. To achieve this, the International Psychosis Epidemiology Consortium (IPEC) has catalogued and harmonized data from early psychosis cohorts and set up a virtual databank.

When T-cells encounter tumour antigens they are activated and promote lymphocyte proliferation and recruitment to the tumour site. This inflammatory response increases blood flow and vascular permeability, which can be measured with dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Early after starting treatment, immune activation will also lead to T-cell tumour infiltration and increased tumour cellularity, which potentially can be quantified by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and radiomics features derived from computational image analysis. Preliminary data suggests that texture measures can capture the spatial heterogeneity of different sites of disease and predict treatment resistance and progression-free survival in the metastatic setting. Moreover, MRI measurements that integrate whole tumour volumetry, diffusion-weighted imaging (ADC) and radiomics (texture analysis) (Larkin T.J. et al.; 2014, Booth T.C. et al., 2017; Newman A.M. et al., 2015) may provide a therapy response assessment. Preliminary data suggests that texture measures can capture the spatial heterogeneity of metastases and predict treatment resistance and progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Aim Demonstrate and validate (1) PET with a 89Zrlabelled anti-CD8 minibody, to visualize serially the presence of CD8 expressing T-lymphocytes in cancer patients receiving CIT; (2) contribution of MRI measurements of intra- and inter-site tumour heterogeneity. Study design In patients with potential relevant indication for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition treatment (CIT) (e.g. melanoma or NSCLC) and at least one accessible lesion for biopsy, [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 PET imaging (1.5 mg anti human CD8 minibody [89Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, 37 MBq) will be injected and imaging will be performed before the start and 7 days before the 3rd checkpoint inhibitor administration. Whole body [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 distribution will be determined: tumour and normal organ radioactive tracer uptake will be quantified as standardized uptake values (SUV). Patients will undergo multi-parametric MR before and after the 1st cycle and before the 3rd cycle (drugs administered on 2-3 weekly cycles). The third and final MRI will be performed within ~9 weeks after the start of treatment, or on disease progression, whichever is sooner. All metastases determined to be suitable for MR imaging will be evaluated to assess differential tumour response and pseudo-progression. Patients will also undergo contrast-enhanced CT to determine tumour response using iRECIST. Tumour biopsies will be extensively analysed. Statistical considerations: Initial feasibility will be shown in 12 patients. Depending on the tumour type chosen the number of patients required may be increased in order to have sufficient patients with a tumour response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DHL,,Dutch institute for health and welfare,,DHL,Data source,,,,,,,"Currently, the Netherlands has multisource financing of healthcare. Universal health insurance coverage is accessible for all citizens and permanent residents in the country, with a range of comprehensive health services. Municipalities (currently around 300) are responsible for arranging and funding health care. Health services are divided into primary health care and specialized medical care. Primary health care refers to the municipally arranged services provided at municipal health centres. Specialised medical care refers to secondary and tertiary health care, provided by experts on medical specialities largely provided in hospitals. Municipalities or joint municipal authorities may also procure health care services from private service providers. Employers are responsible for preventive health care of their employees. On a voluntary basis, some also provide medical care. Medical care provided by employers and private healthcare also receive some public funding.

Finnish Instititute for Health and Welfare (THL) collects information and produces a range of statistics in the field of social welfare and health care. As a statistical authority, THL is responsible for the maintenance and development of statistical and register resources. THL is hosting the Drugs and Pregnancy research project, a joint project of the THL, the Finnish Medicines Agency (FIMEA) and the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The project aims to secure safe medical drug use during pregnancy. 

The underlying population of all the data banks is the whole population of Finland (around 5.6 million inhabitants).
