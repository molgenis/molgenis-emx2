BIB,,Born in Bradford,,BIB,Cohort study,,Birth cohort,,,,https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/,"Born in Bradford (BiB) started in 2007 as a response to the poor health outcomes for children in Bradford. Pregnant women were recruited when they attended the Bradford Royal Infirmary for their routine maternity care. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about different aspects of their lives including demographics information, physical and mental health and socio-economic information.

Between 2007 and 2011, 12,453 pregnant women were recruited and 3,353 of their partners. Participants also gave permission for routine data linkage for themselves and their children. The BiB cohort is split between approximately 50% South Asian and 50% non-South Asian participants.

BiB has completed a number of sub-sample studies including BiB1000, which focused on exploring ethnic variation and risk factors of childhood obesity. Data collection included questionnaires with parents when the children were between 6 and 36 months at 6 monthly intervals.The ALLIN and MeDALL studies focused on the relationships between childhood allergies and infections. Data collection for these studies were done via a questionnaire and, for the MeDALL study, children were asked to have a skin allergy test.

Since 2016, BiB have undertaken a full cohort follow-up compromising of home visits for data collection through questionnaires, school visits where children carried out cognitive assessments, and a child measurement programme where children were weighed and measured, had their activity levels measured, and were asked to give a blood sample.

From the findings of these studies, BiB have developed a range of additional research projects such as evaluating and developing new interventions to improve health; for example, focusing on reducing childhood obesity, increasing physical activity, improving oral health and improving mental wellbeing. BiB have gone beyond functioning as an observational birth cohort and are actively trying to build and strengthen local research capacity and translate evidence to practice.",Multicultural,,,,,2007,,,,,,,https://license-placeholder.nl,1900-01-28 00:00:00.0,1900-01-28 00:00:00.0,Longitudinal,,,,"Retrospective,Prospective",,,,,,,,,,,12453,,,,,,Bradford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BIB,Bob,Ross,BIB,Bob,Ross,BIB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,general research use,return to database or resource,"Born in Bradford allows researchers to apply to access the study data through the BiB Executive Group.
