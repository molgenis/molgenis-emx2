1,de novo allele origin,,"Describes an allele that originated through a mutation event in a germ cell of one of the parents, or in the fertilized egg itself during early embryogenesis. De novo alleles are* heritable* but *not inherited*.
We distinguish germline, somatic, and de novo allele origin based on a combination two key criteria - whether the allele *inherited* from a parent, and whether it is *heritble' by offspring. De novo variants are *heritable* but not *inherited* - as they are not observed constitutively in either parent, but can be passed to offspring in virtue of their being present in the individual's germ cells. By contrast, germline variants are both inherited (passed down from a parent) and heritable (passable down to offspring), and somatic variants are neither inherited or heritable - having originated via a spontaneous mutation in a non-germ cell. De novo variants appear for the first time in one family member. They often explain genetic disorders in which an affected child has a mutation in every cell in the body but the parents do not, and there is no family history of the disorder.",GENO,GENO:0000880,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000880
2,inherited allele origin,,Describes an allele that is inherited from a parent.,GENO,GENO:0000974,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000974
3,biparental allele origin,inherited allele origin,"Describes an allele that is part of an allelic complement where one allele is maternally inherited and other paternally inherited.
Biparental inheritance of alleles is typical of normal mendelian inheritance, where offspring inherit a maternal and a paternal copies of a given gene.",GENO,GENO:0000976,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000976
4,germline allele origin,inherited allele origin,"Describes an allele that is inherited from a parent in virtue of the allele being present in the germline of one of the parents.
We distinguish germline, somatic, and de novo allele origin based on a combination two key criteria - whether the allele *inherited* from a parent, and whether it is *heritble' by offspring. Germline variants are both *inherited* (present constitutively in a parent and passed down to offspring) and *heritable* (passable down to future offspring). By contrast, somatic variants are neither inherited or heritable - having originated via a spontaneous mutation in a non-germ cell. Traits caused by de novo mutations in germ cells are not inherited but are typically heritable, as they originated through a spontaneous mutation that made them present a germ cells.",GENO,GENO:0000888,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000888
5,maternal allele origin,germline allele origin,Describes an allele that is inherited from a female parent in virtue of the allele being present in the mother's egg.,GENO,GENO:0000878,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000878
6,paternal allele origin,germline allele origin,Describes an allele that is inherited from a male parent in virtue of the allele being present in the father's sperm.,GENO,GENO:0000879,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000879
7,uniparental allele origin,inherited allele origin,"Describes an allele that is part of an allelic complement where both alleles are inherited from the same parent.
From Wikidedia: Uniparental inheritance is a non-mendelian form of inheritance that consists of the transmission of genotypes from one parental type to all progeny. That is, all the genes in offspring will originate from only the mother or only the father. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniparental_inheritance",GENO,GENO:0000975,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000975
8,somatic allele origin,,"Describes an allele that result from some spontaneous mutation event in a somatic cell after fertilization, and thus are not present in every cell in the body.
We distinguish germline, somatic, and de novo allele origin based on a combination two key criteria - whether the allele *inherited* from a parent, and whether it is *heritble' by offspring. Somatic variants are neither inherited or heritable - having originated via a spontaneous mutation in a non-germ cell. By contrast, germline variants are both inherited (passed down from a parent) and heritable (passable down to offspring). De novo mutations are not inherited but are typically heritable, as they originated through a spontaneous mutation that made them present in germ cells. These acquired mutations are called 'somatic' because they typically affect somatic (non-germ) cells. But when spontaneous do mutations occur in the germ cells of an organism, these can be passed on to offspring in whom they will be considered de novo mutations.",GENO,GENO:0000882,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000882
9,unknown allele origin,,Describes an allele whose origin is not known.,GENO,GENO:0000881,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000881
