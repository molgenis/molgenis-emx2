aneusomic zygosity,,geno,GENO_0000392,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000392,"A zygosity quality inhering in a 'single locus complement' in a genome with an abnormal ploidy at the location (i.e. an autosomal locus with one or three copies in a diploid genome)."

disomic zygosity,,geno,GENO_0000391,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000391,"A zygosity quality inhering in a 'single locus complement' in a genome with a normal ploidy of two (i.e. two copies of autosomal chromosomes). Disomic zygosity terms describe the degree of similarity of the two sequence features that reside at a particular location across homozygous chromosomes (or the state of being the only feature at a given locus in the case of hemizygosity)."
nullizygous,disomic zygosity,geno,GENO_0000978,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000978,"A disomic zygosity quality inhering in a 'single locus complement' that is comprised of two non-functional copies of a gene. Loss of function may result from the gene being entirely missing via a deletion, or mutated in a way that eliminates its function."
homozygous,disomic zygosity,geno,GENO_0000136,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000136,"A zygosity quality inhering in a 'single locus complement' where all copies of the feature at this location have the same sequence (in a eukaryotic diploid genome, this means having identical alleles on each of the two homologous chromosomes, one inherited from each parent)."
heterozygous,disomic zygosity,geno,GENO_0000135,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000135,"A zygosity quality inhering in a 'single locus complement' where the copies of the feature at this location have at least one difference in sequence  (in a eukaryotic diploid genome, this means having two distinct alleles on each of the two homologous chromosomes, one inherited from each parent)."
simple heterozygous,heterozygous,geno,GENO_0000458,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000458,a heterozygous quality inhering in a single locus complement comprised of one variant allele and one wild-type/reference allele (e.g.fgf8a<ti282a/+>)
compound heterozygous,heterozygous,geno,GENO_0000402,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000402,A heterozygous quality inhering in a single locus complement comprised of two different varaint alleles and no wild type locus. (e.g.fgf8a<ti282a>/fgf8a<x15>)
hemizygous,disomic zygosity,geno,GENO_0000134,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000134,"A zygosity quality inhering in a 'single locus complement' with half the number of alleles than normal (e.g. a single allele in a diploid genome, for example, a locus on the Y chromosome in a eukaryotic male genome, or a transgene that is present only in one of the two parental chromosome sets)"
