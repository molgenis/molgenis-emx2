18,Middle age onset,Adult onset,hp,HP_0003596,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003596,A type of adult onset with onset of symptoms at the age of 40 to 60 years.; Middle age is of course not amenable to precise definitions. We suggest using this term for onset of disease symptoms between the age of 40 and 60 years.

7,Congenital onset,,hp,HP_0003577,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003577,"A phenotypic abnormality that is present at birth.; Congenital onset literally means present at birth. Congenital abnormalities are thus generally acquired during fetal development. Congenital abnormalities are often but not always hereditary in nature. Whether a disease manifestation is diagnosed to be intrauterine or congenital may depend on the time at which diagnostic procedures are performed. Thus, most congenital abnormalities are also intrauterine. This term should be used for phenotypic abnormalities or diseases initially observed at the time of birth. For abnormalities observed prior to (e.g., by fetal ultrasound), use the term Antenatal onset (HP:0030674)."
