It can be seen that the miscarriages have been classified according to the gestation at which the miscarriage took place. For 18 pregnancieswhatever reason. However  fetuses that died in utero but for whom labour had to be induced are coded as miscarriages. It can be seen that the miscarriages have been classified according to the gestation at which the miscarriage took place. For 18 pregnancies  there was no reliable information that allowed us to estimate the gestation at miscarriage and these are coded as miscarriage gestation not known. Terminations were classified according to whether they were for a congenital malformation (code 6) or other reasons (code 7). Note that women intending to have a termination for social reasons were unlikely to take part in the study. There was a miscellaneous group of 9 pregnancies with outcomes before 20 weeks that did not conform to the definition of either a miscarriage or termination - and these are coded separately (code 8). They include ectopic pregnancies and hydatidiform moles.,,,
