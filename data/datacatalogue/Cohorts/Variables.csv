Termination is deliberate delivery of a fetus  for  fetuses that died in utero but for whom labour had to be induced are coded as miscarriages. It can be seen that the miscarriages have been classified according to the gestation at which the miscarriage took place. For 18 pregnancieswhatever reason. However  fetuses that died in utero but for whom labour had to be induced are coded as miscarriages. It can be seen that the miscarriages have been classified according to the gestation at which the miscarriage took place. For 18 pregnancies  there was no reliable information that allowed us to estimate the gestation at miscarriage and these are coded as miscarriage gestation not known. Terminations were classified according to whether they were for a congenital malformation (code 6) or other reasons (code 7). Note that women intending to have a termination for social reasons were unlikely to take part in the study. There was a miscellaneous group of 9 pregnancies with outcomes before 20 weeks that did not conform to the definition of either a miscarriage or termination - and these are coded separately (code 8). They include ectopic pregnancies and hydatidiform moles.,,,
ALSPAC,core,mz023,,,Gestn at miscarriage or delivery (weeks),continuous,week,,"Gestation when the pregnancy ended. In regard to miscarriages this will be the gestation at the time at which the fetus was thought to have died rather than the time at which the fetus was expelled. For all infants that were delivered after twenty weeks, if there  as  any suggestion that the gestation was preterm (i.e. less than 37 weeks) then the clinical records were reviewed by Professor Ian MacGillivray in the likelihood of the recorded gestation being correct or otherwise. Clinical records were reviewed not only for  pregnancies that appeared preterm using the mother’s LMP but also if the clinically recorded gestation based on ultrasound or the clinician’s impression was less than 37 weeks or if the paediatric estimate of gestation was less than 37 weeks.",,,
