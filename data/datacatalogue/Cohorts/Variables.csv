Fill out a separate form for each malformed baby/fetus in a multiple set.
Only one form to be completed for conjoined twins (Siamese). The code is “2” for a conjoined twin, unless another baby was delivered at the same time (code “3”).
Conjoined twins have a specific ICD/BPA code, to be coded under “syndrome” (variable 27). Give full description of type of conjoined twinning in syndrome text field (variables 28).

Any other malformations are coded in variables 29-44.

Notes. If code 8 is used, please specify in variable sp_twin the gestational age at which last known to be a multiple pregnancy and/or first known to be a singleton. The purpose of this coding system is to allow us to distinguish malformed cases which would have civil registration as singleton births from malformed cases which would have civil registration as multiple births. Please specify the sex and outcome (live, still) of the malformed/non-malformed co-twin and zygosity.",,"1 = Singleton

When each anomaly was first diagnosed.
The basis for this variable is to record whether the prenatal findings strongly suggest the postnatal diagnosis. This variable is not designed for fetal medicine specialists to assess the accuracy of their prenatal diagnosis. Thus the finding of a significant heart anomaly prenatally is considered to be prenatally detected, even if the exact anomaly was not correctly diagnosed. ‘Yes, prenatally diagnosed’, should be used when the prenatal finding is nearly 100% predictive of the congenital anomaly. ‘Partially’ means that the prenatal finding is consistent with the postnatal anomaly but has a lesser predictive value, being suggestive of more than one type of anomaly, an example here would be increased nuchal translucency. The examples below are to illustrate this principle and ensure consistency of coding. Queries about individual cases can be send to Central registry",,"1 = Yes,this anomaly was diagnosed prenatally

3) may be reported to EUROCAT but will not be included in prevalence data.

The distinction between stillbirth and spontaneous abortion should follow the definitions in use in your country (to be specified in your Registry Description). There is usually a lower gestational age limit or birthweight limit for stillbirths. This varies from country to country. Below this limit fetal deaths are called spontaneous abortions.

Terminations of pregnancy refer to cases where prenatal diagnosis was made of malformation in a live fetus and the pregnancy was then terminated. If the fetus died spontaneously in utero either before or after prenatal diagnosis of malformation then it should be coded as spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, not as termination of pregnancy. If a termination was performed for other reasons than malformation, the case should not be transmitted to Central Registry. This means that early terminations where there was no suspicion of malformation before termination should be excluded from the case files.

Stillbirths or perinatal deaths resulting from termination of pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis must be coded as terminations (value = 4), irrespective of civil registration status.

For a non-natural fetal reduction in a multiple pregnancy where one fetus is malformed, code 4 (in that case gestlength = gestational age at reduction; date of birth = date of reduction; and code carefully all multiple birth
