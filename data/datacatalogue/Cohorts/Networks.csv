LifeCycle,,LifeCycle,The LifeCycle Project,,,https://lifecycle-project.eu/,,,,"A Europe-wide network of cohort studies started in early life Cohort studies started from pregnancy or childhood give the unique opportunity to relate early-life stressors with variation in development, health and disease throughout the life course. Moreover, advanced analytical approaches used in observational studies can help identify causality and potential for early-life interventions on factors that cannot be easily studied in experimental settings. These factors include socioeconomic circumstances, migration, urban environment as well as lifestyle-related determinants and will be given particular focus in our project. We will set up a European pregnancy and childhood cohort, the EU Child Cohort Network, which brings together extensive existing data from more than 250,000 European children and their parents. These cohorts enable studies in multiple generations because of their detailed phenotyping of both parents and children. The network will bring together existing successful multidisciplinary cohort studies, which all started before or during pregnancy or in childhood. Together, they span the full life course and contain detailed phenotypical information as well as biological samples. The EU Child Cohort Network will optimize exploitation of more than 40 available cohort resources in Europe and will enable innovative research on identification of novel markers of early-life stressors related to health trajectories throughout the full life cycle. Although LifeCycle partners and their cohorts have taken the initiative for this unique collaboration, the network is open to other partners with population-based cohorts started in early life, specifically those from Eastern and Southern Europe. To ensure that this will be a Europe-wide, open and sustainable network, which exceeds the LifeCycle Project duration, we will introduce a data sharing platform taking account of ethical, legal and societal implications, we will organize yearly meetings open to all European pregnancy and child cohort researchers and we will start a fellowship programme for exchange between these European cohorts.",,,,,,,,,,"ELFE,GECKO,ALSPAC",LifeCycle_CDM,
ATHLETE,,ATHLETE,Advancing Tools for Human Early Lifecourse Exposome Research and Translation,h2020,,https://athleteproject.eu/,,,,"Children are particularly vulnerable to environmental hazards. The ATHLETE project will measure a wide range of environmental exposures (urban, chemical, lifestyle and social risk factors) during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. The project will then link this “early-life exposome” to children’s biological responses and cardiometabolic, respiratory, and mental health. The results will help us to better understand and prevent health damage from environmental agents from the earliest parts of the life course onward.",,,,,,,,,,"DNBC,PELAGIE,G21,ELSPAC,BIB,GenR,Sepages,INMA,EDEN,MoBa,KANC,GenR Next",ATHLETE_CDM,
IPEC,,IPEC,International Psychosis Epidemiology Consortium,harmonization,,https://www.ipec-project.com/,UMCG,"UMCG,GGZ Drenthe,GGZ Friesland,Lentis Research,UCPH",,"There are many early psychosis cohorts in the world. Epidemiological research with these cohorts over the past decades has greatly increased the understanding of distribution and mechanisms of psychotic disorders. Carrying out cross-country comparisons on a larger scale is extremely costly. An alternative strategy is to pool the existing large amount of data from high-quality early psychosis studies at an individual patient level. This approach has multiple advantages: it allows for examining psychosis determinants with greater precision, also including rare exposures and outcomes, focusing on (long-term) follow-up, and making optimal use of already existing data. To achieve this, the International Psychosis Epidemiology Consortium (IPEC) has catalogued and harmonized data from early psychosis cohorts and set up a virtual databank. With this databank, multiple (epidemiological) studies within the scope of the following research question will be conducted: “What drives the course of functional, existential and clinical outcomes of (early) psychosis and how does the social and geographical context shape these patterns?”.",,"Denmark,Netherlands (the)",2023,,,"IPEC was supported by the 2020 SIRS Research Harmonization Group Award which included a grant in the amount of $5000 USD to Prof. Wim Veling and Prof. Craig Morgan; an internal MD-PhD research grant of the University Medical Center Groningen (grant number 18-41) to Vera Brink, MSc; a grant in the amount of 400,000 DKK of the Capital Regions Research council to Dr Nikolai Albert; and the participating institutions (Lentis Psychiatric Institute, GGZ Drenthe, GGZ Friesland, University Center Psychiatry of University Medical Center Groningen, Bispebjerg hospital, Psychiatric Hospital Risskov, and Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen).","IPEC wishes to acknowledge the services of all the study participants, staff, research groups, and institutions collaborating in IPEC, and of MOLGENIS and RoQua, who helped build and maintain the technical infrastructure.",,,PSYCONN,IPEC_CDM,
