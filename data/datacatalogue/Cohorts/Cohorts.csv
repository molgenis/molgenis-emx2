Between April 1991 and December 1992 we recruited more than 14,000 pregnant women into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.

We are the most detailed study of its kind in the world and we provide the international research community with a rich resource for the study of the environmental and genetic factors that affect a person’s health and development. Through our research we aim to inform policy and practices that will provide a better life for future generations.",United Kingdom,"Children,Mothers,Partners","During the index pregnancy, most women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent 22 additional questionnaires that refer to their own health and well-being. Since 2008, women have attended four focus clinical ssessments

Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with 64 data collection time points between birth and 24 years of age. These include 34 child-completed questionnaires, 20 focus clinical assessments and 23 questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver.

Partners have been sent 17 questionnaires and have attended 1 focus clinic assessment.

Siblings and grandparents have been recruited.",1990,,42710,,,"“The UK Medical Research Council and Wellcome (Grant ref: 217065/Z/19/Z) and the University of Bristol provide core support for ALSPAC.
