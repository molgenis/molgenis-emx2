Swertz developed from scratch into a team of 21 PhD students, postdocs and programmers developing pipelines, databases and services to unlock the full potential of next-generation biobanking, *omics, translational, personalized medicine and systems genetics data. During his PhD in bioinformatics (2008) he researched innovative and powerful methods for the efficient modeling, production, and evolution of flexible biological software infrastructures for post-genomic research data and analysis (NatRevGen, 2007). This resulted in MOLGENIS bioinformatics integration platform, which he released as open source (http://www.molgenis.org). Then he moved as postdoc to the UMCG genetics department to apply his expertise and developed many multidisciplinary collaborations on local, national and EU level using and evolving the MOLGENIS toolbox to advance GWAS, GWL, microarray, proteomics, metabolomics, biobank and animal experiments. All this international work resulted in an invited 2 year (Rubicon award) stay at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Now he is leading (inter)national activities in data curation, analysis and e-infrastructure for sequencing, biobanking, and diagnostics, including lead of BBMRI-NL IT/bioinformatics, co-lead of Health Data sector of Dutch Techcenter for Lifescience (host of ELIXIR-NL), member CTMM/TraIT architecture board (host of EATRISNL), board member of IT programme Netherlands University Medical Centers (NFU), project lead of BBMRINL Genome of the Netherlands, project lead of the VKGL national data sharing of NGS diagnostics and WP lead in EUBioMedBridges, EU-BioSHARE, and Top Institute Food & Nutrition"
