Electron microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-3939,"visual and photographic microscopy in which electron beams with wavelengths thousands of times shorter than visible light are used in place of light, thereby allowing much greater magnification."
Light microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4001-0073,using a beam of visible light and optical magnification to image a specimen.
Confocal scanning microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4000-0152,"indirect imaging technique which uses a sharply focused light source (typically a laser) to excite fluors or otherwise visualize the specimen one point at a time; 2 or 3 dimensional likenesses are then reconstructed by computer; relatively noninvasive, applicable to thick sections and living tissue."
Ultraviolet microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4749,microscopy in which the image is formed by ultraviolet radiation.
High voltage electron microscopy,Electron microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4000-0201,"type of transmission EM employing an electron beam powerful enough to penetrate thick (up to 2 u) sections which, when precisely tilted through a range of angles, produces a series of images that can be computer processed into a 3-dimensional likeness of the specimen."
Atomic force microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4003-0003,"indirect, molecular-resolution imaging technique in which 3- dimensional tracings of a mobile probe across the specimen's surface are processed by computer into a topological image; in contrast to STM the probe is driven only by the mechanical resistance (topology and viscoelasticity) of the surface."
Scanning transmission electron microscopy,Electron microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4003-0051,"form of electron microscopy based on scanning with an extremely narrow beam that is transmitted through the sample; the detection apparatus produces an image whose brightness depends on the atomic number of the sample, and therefore reveals chemical composition as well as gross molecular shape."
Transmission electron microscopy,Electron microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4001-0137,original electron microscopic technique; the photographic imaging of a sample created by a beam of electrons passing through a thin section; resolution ranges from macromolecular to cellular.
Immunoelectron microscopy,Electron microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4358,microscopy in which the samples are first stained immunocytochemically and then examined using an electron microscope.
Intravital microscopy,Video microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4007-0073,observation of a system in a living organism by microscopy.
Scanning electron microscopy,Electron microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-3953,"microscopy in which the object is examined directly by an electron beam scanning the specimen point by point, giving the surface image a three dimensional quality."
Cryoelectron microscopy,Electron microscopy,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4008-0029,"three-dimensional image reconstruction technique whereby an aqueous suspension of a sample is applied in an extremely thin film to a grid, frozen in liquid nitrogen, maintained in this state by means of a special mount, and then observed in the electron microscope."
Interference microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4465,"microscopy utilizing a direct beam of light which splits and recombines as it passes through the specimen, forming a pattern that corresponds to variations in the specimen's thickness and refraction; used to examine transparent objects such as living cells."
Video microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/4004-0010,video recording of images formed by a microscope.
Infrared microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4394,microscopy in which the image is formed by infrared radiation.
Phase contrast microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4536,form of interference microscopy in which variations of the refracting index in the object are converted into variations of intensity in the image.
Scanning tunneling microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4589,"indirect, molecular-resolution imaging technique based on the surface tracings of a mobile probe; in contrast to AFM the probe is driven by ionic tunneling and the image therefore depends on the conductance properties of the specimen."
Fiber optic microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4010,
X ray microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4820,
Fluorescence microscopy,,http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CSP/2138-4252,"microscope that irradiates fluorescent materials or specimens with ultraviolet, violet, and occasionally blue light, causing the materials to fluoresce."
