The goal of P2N is to establish a sustainable biobank infrastructure at UKSH, Campus Kiel and Kiel University to ensure scientific research with quality-controlled human biomaterial. P2N and its members were funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research between 2011 and 2016 as part of the national biobanking initiative (cBMB). The goal of all cBMB sites was to optimize and professionalize the operation and use of their pre-existing local biobanks. P2N established administrative umbrella structures for a central biobank of the Medical Faculty at the University Medical Center of Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH), Campus Kiel, including rules of procedure, uniform steering and governance structures, forms and regulations for sample submission, uniform database software (CentraXX), the regulation of ethical and legal issues and quality management.
