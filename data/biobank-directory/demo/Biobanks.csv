Founded in 2010, it initially collected, processed, stored and mainly liquid samples such as urine, serum, plasma and saliva from epidemiological studies of the Leipzig Research Centre for Civilisation Diseases (LIFE) and made them available for research projects.

In 2017, the collection of tissue samples from patients with tumour diseases also started in cooperation with the University Cancer Centre Leipzig (UCCL), the Institute of Pathology, various clinics of Leipzig University Hospital and the Institute of Laboratory Medicine. The focus there is currently on malignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, breast and uterus as well as sarcomas and malignant haematological diseases. Since 2021, samples from patients with cardiovascular diseases have also been stored with the Vascular Centre of Leipzig University Hospital.

The samples are processed in a highly standardised and traceable manner and stored predominantly at temperatures of -80°C or at <-150°C in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. Storage is carried out in strict compliance with an uninterrupted cold chain and constant monitoring. All samples are clearly identified by a barcode and can thus be linked to quality-relevant data such as processing and storage times as well as to clinical data of the donor. This means that comprehensive data sets are also available for the samples. 

The biobank also supports project partners in the planning and implementation of projects regarding sample collection, processing, storage and provision. In this way, it has also been possible to implement sample collections for scientific accompanying projects of clinical studies. Scientists at the University of Leipzig and cooperating institutions can access the biomaterial and database for research purposes via a project agreement.

It functions as a service provider for the scientific and medical community as a whole. The Bank collects blood samples that originate from sample collection campaigns run by research teams, biologists and geneticists in France and abroad. The management and traceability of the samples (processing, storage, distribution and partnerships) are provided by the database known as 'Stocky' - specially developed at Genethon for the DNA Bank.The activities of the DNA and Cell Bank are as follows: oCollecting blood or DNA from patients affected with genetic diseases and their families with the minimum identification data necessary for the monitoring and follow-up of samples. oProcessing the samples in order to make them available to the scientific community and perpetuating DNA preservation (serum isolation and DNA extraction), isolating lymphocytes and establishing lymphoblastoid B lines and primary cultures (myoblasts and fibroblasts). oStoring samples for future research and preserving the genetic heritage by ensuring the long-term physical security of the preserved samples. oDistributing samples as necessary for ongoing research while complying with the principles and laws of bioethics and using the best available technologies at minimum cost.

Using a biochemical assay with successive protein enrichment from frozen brain slices, we isolated ferritin light and heavy chains in a so far not known dominant autosomal disease. Our studies have provided additional knowledge and insights in the growing area of ferritin-related neurodegeneration disease. In the field of Creutzfeldt jakob disease, we provide an alternative biochemical definition of PrPSc diversity and new insights in the perception of Human TSE agents' variability. Different brain areas from 41 sCJD and 12 iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) cases (mainly from the Cerebrotheque de Toulouse) were investigated, using two new biochemical assays. We developed several clinical research projects on Alzheimer disease regarding different points: - Anti-amyloid-beta immunization. Besides descrpition of neuropathological lesions, we contributed to a work concluding on the impact of amyloid clearance restablishment on neurite curvature. These data agree with preclinical animal studies and demonstrate that vaccination does not merely clear amyloid from the Alzheimer's disease brain, but reduces some of the neuronal alterations that characterize Alzheimer's disease.- Sphingoloipid molecules implicated in apoptosis. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) has a critical role in regulation of survival of neurons. A previous work on culture cells in our research team (INSERM U858), showed that in vitro, neuronal loss was induced by ?-amyloid peptide 25-35 and it was correlated with alteration of sphingolipid biostat. Our hypothesis is that SphK1 is differentially expressed in neurons regarding their location in the vicinity or far from amyloid deposits in the brain of patients affected with AD.

However, the exclusive targeting of mitogenic mechanisms has shown two crucial limitations: the emergence of chemo-resistance within target cells and evasion promoted by tumor heterogeneity. In this context, the researchers and clinicians involved in this project share the will to focus their studies on intrinsic and extrinsic determinants that allow pre-cancer and cancer cells to escape from onco-suppressive barriers (apoptosis, senescence, interactions with the immune system and the microenvironment), with the aim to develop innovative therapeutic approaches designed to specifically target cancerous cell survival processes. The foundations of this project can thus be found in the scientific links that have been forged over the past few years between the diverse INSERM and CNRS units present on the site (INSERM Unit 590, UMR CNRS 5238, UMR CNRS 5201, INSERM Unit 865, and INSERM Unit 871), in the framework of this restricted but promising aspect of cancer research. Hence, above and beyond cancer research that unifies the different groups, the members of these various laboratories have expressed the will to define and develop common priority research themes:-The study of mechanisms of tumoral escape. The aim of this research axis, within the framework of specific tumor types (breast cancers, intestinal tumors, pancreatic tumors, virally-induced hepatic tumors, sarcomas, neuroblastomas, hematological malignancies), is to identify the mechanisms that allow cancerous cells to evade the intrinsic safeguard responses of the cell. It comprises three sub-themes with numerous interrelations both in conceptual terms and in terms of applied research:osub-theme 1 is the characterization of mechanisms allowing cancers to avoid intrinsic onco suppressive processes (senescence and apoptosis);osub theme 2 is the analysis of mechanisms of avoiding immuno surveillance;osub-theme 3 is the pre-clinical evaluation that the re-engagement of these safeguard mechanisms can be promising therapeutic approaches. The long-term objective is to improve understanding of the involvement of these mechanisms in the processes of tumor progression, metastasis and chemo-resistance, so as to be able to propose innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring these safety systems and identifying new diagnostic and predictive factors. -Analysis of the perversion of information flow by the carcinogenic process. In multi-cellular organisms, the continuous integration of signals from the microenvironment by normal cells requires the onset of specific genetic programs which express information stored in the hereditary material and, through transcription and translation, transfer this information to the effector molecules. At each step, major and multiple differences between normal and cancer cells are evidenced. The objective of this research theme is the identification of those differences that may be instrumental in determining the phenotypic divergence between normal and malignant states. These programs are recognized as being innovative and involving collaboration between groups. As such they form part of the priority research approaches cancer cluster CLARA (Canceropole Lyon-Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne). The approach ""Tumoral Escape"" forms the core of the research program of the Fondation de Cooperation Scientifique ""Synergie Lyon Cancer"" (Scientific Cooperation Foundation ""Lyon Cancer Synergy"") created in 2007 following the nationwide call for proposals from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, in order to create the Reseau Thematique de Recherche et de Soins (RTRS) (Thematic Network Research and Care). Furthermore, the work on the role of immunosurveillance as well as the analysis of virally induced cancers are developed within the framework of the scientific priorities of the Fondation ""Innovations en Infectiologie"" (FINOVI) and the Lyon Biopole, thereby creating close links between research themes of the sites of Lyon-Est and Lyon Sud-Gerland.",http://www.centreleonberard.fr/827-Les-plateformes-de-recherche-de-transfert.clb.aspx?language=fr-FR,Lyon,FR,45.7412392,4.878632599999946,bbmri-eric:contactID:FR_BB-0033-00050,bbmri-eric:contactID:FR_BB-0033-00050,CRB institutionnel Centre Leon Berard,,,,true,true,FR,true

The main scientific project of our CRB was based on the approach genotype-intermediate phenotype related to CVD. Beyond the STANISLAS Cohort, this latest integrated other populations and particularly, a population of hypertensive patients. Actually, always in the same direction, we are interested in an integrative approach which takes into consideration: 1) the different metabolic pathways involved in the CVD, 2) a great number of information on genetics, mRNA and circulating proteins and 3) the intermediate phenotypes in the plasma/serum as well as in the PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) (bank of RNA and protein extracts of PBMCs in the 3rd recruitment of the STANISLAS Cohort, during 2003-2005). In 2008, we associated to this strategy which was essentially focused on the candidate-gene approach, the pangenomic approach.

However, their quality and the particular viruses collected usually reflect the interest of the laboratory.  Moreover, when laboratories are re-organized, closed down or the virologist leaves or retires, many of these collections are lost to science. The European Virus Archive (EVA) was conceived as a direct response to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organizations and industry, initially within Europe but ultimately throughout the World.  In preparing the FP7 proposal, it was emphasized that it would be impossible to generate a wide ranging viral archive in a single laboratory complex. Thus, the ""virology club tradition"" was retained by developing an integrated infrastructure via consortia, operating through validated networks. Initially, 9 laboratories within the EU were directly associated to compose the core of the network.  EVA provides access to viruses through European laboratories by integrating their collections and devising validated protocols and effective dissemination procedures, the partner laboratories work to identical high standards in producing and supplying authenticated viruses to the scientific community globally. This has been obtained through intense exchanges of know-how consisting of workshops, trainings and staff exchanges. The current EVA organization is satisfactorily operating: about 1000 products have been distributed worldwide. Ultimately, the EVA network should generate the largest collection of animal and plant viruses in Europe and ultimately in the world and should move beyond the current state-of-the-art to provide a valuable resource and service.

Since its creation, the CIRM has integrated over 12 Inra collections and has become a unique blend of collections associated to research on agro-food, biotechnology and human, animal and plant health. In addition to strain authentication, characterization, preservation, and distribution, the CIRM provides a number of services including taxonomic identification, full strain characterization, strain typing, confidential safe deposit and expertise in various fields. The CIRM is very active in the characterization and preservation of biodiversity from French oversea territories. The five sites are all ISO 9001 certified.The main research interests are: -Biodiversity and taxonomy: the five CIRM sites are involved in molecular taxonomy, design of new methods for identification and species description-Comparative genomics: the Grignon site, as a founder member of Genolevures, the French yeast genome sequencing consortium, has been involved in several comparative genomics projects since 1998.-Biotechnology: the Marseilles site is involved in several national and European projects studying the enzymatic potentiality of filamentous fungi for white and green biotechnologies. The Rennes site is involved in biotransformation of milk and cheese technology-Health: the Tours site studies biodiversity and molecular markers of bacterial pathogens and is involved in the determination of the antimicrobial spectrum of different molecules. The Rennes and Grignon sites are involved in projects on microbiological safety of foodstuff Since the start of 2009, the CIRM is coordinator, together with the Institut Pasteur, of the European project EMbaRC, which aims at establishing a self-sustainable community of European Microbial Resource Centers representing a large biodiversity and offering a wide-range of not only bioresources, but also expert services.

Hartwig Medical Foundation established the first national genomic database for cancer research in 2015. The Foundation is also responsible for the management of this database. The first data was made available to researchers in 2017.
The database combines genetic and clinical data (including treatment outcomes) of patients in the Netherlands with metastatic cancer. The database continues to grow with the addition of data from about 100 new patients every month. The genetic data are generated using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), making this unique database the most comprehensive source of data in the world for research into cancer and better treatments of this disease.
Purpose of the database: to find new biomarkers
The genomic database is helping researchers to improve their understanding of cancer. This requires large quantities of data in order to recognize patterns in the disease. This is also how biomarkers are discovered, by identifying the links between genetic mutations, tumor characteristics, drugs and treatment outcome. Hartwig Medical Foundation systematically generates genetic data and collects clinical data and makes these data available to physicians, practitioners and researchers, so that new biomarkers can be discovered faster and existing biomarkers can be improved. In addition to the discovery of new biomarkers, the information can also be used to improve the effectiveness of existing treatments.",https://www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl/,,NL,52.356230,4.958299,bbmri-eric:contactID:NL_vandenbroek,bbmri-eric:contactID:NL_vandenbroek,Stichting Hartwig Medical Foundation,,,,false,true,NL,false

The Licence Holder is the University of Oxford and the Designated Individual (DI) is Dr Clare Verrill. The licence covers activities within Oxford, at the main site, the John Radcliffe Hospital, and at the satellite sites, Cowley Store, Churchill Hospital, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre and Department of Pharmacology.     ORB provides infrastructure to underpin biobank activities and delivers a portfolio of integrated services to users, from acquisition, storage and distribution of biospecimens, through to governance, ethical and regulatory cover. The biospecimens and associated information managed by ORB will be used for research studies that may contribute to increasing the knowledge and understanding of disease in order to improve diagnosis and treatment, and could ultimately lead to improvements in patient care.  ORB was established in 2006 when a number of active and legacy collections within the University of Oxford and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust were brought together for licensing by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA). This was in response to new legislation, the Human Tissue Act (2004), which came into effect on 1 September 2006.     ORB acts as a single gateway for access to the many biospecimen collections held in Oxford. Custodians of collections engage with ORB as part of a federated model. A primary focus of ORB is maintenance of a generic, open-access resource of biospecimens donated by patients and research participants for use in medical research and provision of a simple and efficient system to collect, store, curate, and distribute these biospecimens and associated information.   In response to the requirements of the Human Tissue Act, ORB operates a multi-site Human Tissue Authority Research Licence with policies and procedures in place to ensure registered collections comply with the legislation. ORB also provides storage facilities according to HTA guidelines.   It is recognised that access to large numbers of high-quality, clinically annotated biomaterials is vital for the advancement of medical research and healthcare delivery. ORB facilitates this access and enhances the research infrastructure by working with all stakeholders to ensure effective sharing of information, resources and best practice.",http://orb.ndcls.ox.ac.uk/,,UK,,,,bbmri-eric:contactID:UK_GBR-1-10,University of Oxford,,,,,,UK,true

A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.    Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.    The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine.

LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.    The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 yeasr later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).      Current situation:  The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established.From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.      Sample processing and clinical data:  Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.    Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

However, over the past decade, there has been an ever increasing need for organs throughout the UK, far surpassing the supply. This is a pattern that is predicted to worsen over the next 10 years.    As many as one in three patients on the transplant waiting list will die or become too unwell to receive a transplant as a result of this disparity.     To address this problem, the transplant community have been turning to organs previously considered to be unsuitable for transplantation, including organs from extended criteria donors and non-heart beating donors. In order to do this, QUOD aims to facilitate research by collecting blood, urine and tissue samples of appropriately consented / authorised organ donors. Through this, it may be possible to determine pathways of injury and repair in organs and identify biomarkers which can be used to better predict the outcomes of transplantation.    QUOD is a nationwide programme encompassing all retrieval zones in the UK. These regions include:     •Birmingham / Cardiff  •Cambridge  •Edinburgh  •London Kings  •Manchester / Leeds  •Newcastle  •Oxford / Royal Free    The QUOD team has a wide range of personnel, including specialist nurses, transplant surgeons, academics, management teams and a variety of healthcare professionals.

The HBRC resides within the purpose-built Advanced Therapies Facility (ATF) within the College of Medical and Dental Sciences (CMDS) at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.  Samples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful.   Although the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission. In order to enhance the value of the HBRC collection, every attempt is made to secure the return of useful research data following the completion of research studies.",http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc/index.aspx,,UK,,,,bbmri-eric:contactID:UK_GBR-1-7,University of Birmingham,,,,,,UK,true

The Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).      Sample collections:  Over the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:    • 847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples   • 514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine  • 706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)  • 149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine     All samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases.     Initially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.
