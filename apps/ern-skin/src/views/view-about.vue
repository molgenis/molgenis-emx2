        The European Reference Networks
      </h2>
      <p>
        On March 2017 were launched 24 European Reference Networks (ERNs)
        specialised in rare or low-prevalence complex diseases, marking the
        start of a new era for cooperation in the field of health. The aim was
        to offer the nearly 30 million EU citizens suffering from these diseases
        requiring highly specialised treatment, the opportunity to benefit from
        high quality and cost-effective care everywhere on the European
        territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that respect each of the ERNs covers a specific medical field,
        involving healthcare providers located in Europe to facilitate
        discussion on complex or rare diseases and concentrate knowledge and
        resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The European Reference Network, gathering the 24 ERNs and their
        reference centres, involves more than 900 healthcare units from over 300
        hospitals in 26 EU countries.

        The ERN application was born from

          Network</strong
        >
        active in the Ô¨Åeld for more than 10 years. After being approved by the
        Board of Member States, the ERN-Skin began its journey on March 9, 2017
        along with the 23 other ERNs.

        Most of them are exclusively cutaneous/sub-cutaneous and often present a
        severe prognosis, because of the intensity of the cutaneous/mucosal
        involvement, the risk of cancer for some of them, or the frequent
        multisystemic involvement directly or secondary to skin damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rarity of patients suffering from rare skin diseases and the
        difference in their aetiologies and clinical features make research and
        knowledge slow and difficult, leaving many of them without proper
        diagnosis for their condition or adequate treatments.

        <li>

      <h2 id="our-mission-and-actions-title">Our mission & actions</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the ERN-Skin is to improve the quality of life of
        European patients by offering them highly specialised healthcare and
        support in their daily care while enabling them to remain in their home
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to successfully achieve its goals, members of the ERN-Skin have
        developed a <strong>wide range of actions:</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Cross-border medical cooperation and pooling of knowledge</h3>
      <p>
        The governance of the ERN-Skin is thought to ensure maximum geographical
        and target groups representativity and outreach across the EU.
        Coordinators, elected by the ERN-Skin board which administrates the
        network, are responsible for the day-to-day management of the ERN-Skin,
        and guarantee effective communication and cooperation within the
        network.
      </p>
      <p>
        56 reference centres located in 18 different European countries
        cooperate within the ERN-Skin. Each of them is represented by an
        Official Representative who has the capacity to decide and act in the
        name of the centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wide range of rare skin disorders is distributed in nine thematic
        groups coordinated by one or more chairs. They are supplemented by
        sub-thematic and transversal groups aiming to create synergy between
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Patient representative Council includes patient representatives in
        all structures of the ERN who help ensure that the activities of the
        network reflect the actual needs of patients. They are key pieces of the
        structure, for they convey the concerns, wishes or suggestions of
        patients treated by the members of the ERN-Skin.
      </p>

      <h3>Innovative medical systems</h3>
      <p>
        Every patient, in every European country must benefit from the same
        degree of expertise regarding their condition, and be able to benefit
        from the same therapeutic advances. Which is why the experts within and
        between the thematic groups of the ERN-Skin cooperate everyday through
        systems like CPMS (Clinical Patient Management System) a secure
        web-based application to support European Reference Networks in the
        diagnosis and treatment of rare or complex conditions across national
        borders, or the development of an e-health platform allowing
        telemedicine and registries.
      </p>

      <h3>Development and spreading of guidelines and best practices</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the treatments for rare and complex skin diseases are
        symptomatic. The pooling of knowledge within the ERN-Skin thus favours
        the development of guidelines aiming to improve the training of medical
        staff and paramedics confronted to these rare conditions and offer them
        theoretical and practical courses.
      </p>

      <h3>Multidisciplinary care</h3>
      <p>
        The ERN-Skin is committed to offer multidisciplinary care in order to
        reduce the burden of the patients suffering from rare skin disorders and
        facilitate the access to extended medical resources (psychological,
        social, economic and physical).
      </p>

      <h3>Maximisation of the cost-effective use of resources</h3>
      <p>
        Some disorders require the use of specific medical resources often
        extremely expensive. By concentrating them where appropriate the
        ERN-Skin helps optimizing their use and reduce their costs.
      </p>

      <h3>Better patient management</h3>
      <p>
        To help patients feel acknowledged, the ERN-Skin favours regular
        interactions between doctors and the Patient Representative Councils, or
        other patient groups, which enable better communication and listening
        between doctors and patients.
      </p>

      <h3>Public awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Helping the patients also goes through the increase of public awareness
        and access to information related to rare skin conditions, through
        communication tools like a feature-rich website, newsletters or
        publications.
      </p>

      <h3>Scientific research and improvement of diagnosis</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately the synergy and cooperation developed by the members of the
        ERN-Skin help them reach a better understanding of these complex and
        sometimes overlapping conditions, leading them to improve their
        diagnosis and contribute to an efficient scientific research with the
        objective of finding new treatments and regular advances for all
        patients.

        The ERN-Skin was set up thanks to the support of the Fondation Ren√©
        Touraine and more particularly of the Rare Skin Diseases Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fondation Ren√© Touraine is an international non-governmental and
        non-profit organization recognized of public utility by the French law.
        Its main goal is to support therapeutic progress in dermatology in order
        to help patients suffering from skin diseases all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rare Skin Diseases Network was created in 2003 by the Fondation Ren√©
        Touraine. Its mission is to improve patient care in the field of severe
        and rare genetic skin diseases at national, European and international
        level.

        <strong
          >The Fondation Ren√© Touraine & the Rare Skin Diseases Network play
          also a key role in the organisation of the ERN-Skin with the
          involvement of their staff.</strong
