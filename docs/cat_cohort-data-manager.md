# Cohort or DAP data manager
## Catalogue
### Data harmonisation
Each cohort harmonises their data according to the consortiumâ€™s harmonisation protocols into the CDM format which has been centrally agreed on and stores the data locally in [MOLGENIS Armadillo](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#armadillo). 
###Staging areas for uploads
The cohort or DAP metadata is uploaded to what are called "staging areas" of the Data Catalogue.
LifeCycle, ATHLETE and LongITools use [*data-catalogue-staging*](https://data-catalogue-staging.molgeniscloud.org).
ConcePTION uses [*emx2-conception*](https://emx2-conception.test.molgenis.org).
You will need credentials to log in and upload metadata for your cohort.

When you log in, you will be able to at least see the following databases:

-Catalogue: The common data models of your consortia, which you need to use in the mappings or ETL.

-CatalogueOntologies: This database contains the look-up list that you need for filling out some columns in the templates, e.g. format or unit. If you need to add anything to these look-up lists, contact us at [molgenis-support](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl).

-You own cohort's or DAP's database that you can use to upload the filled out templates.

### Define cohort or DAP metadata
[MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#/variable-explorer/) provides a framework to describe in detail cohort metadata, definitions of the data variables collected (aka 'source variables'), and mappings to common data models (aka 'target variables'). Its purpose is to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts together.

- The cohort or DAP metadata provides descriptive information such as contact details, name of the cohort, and high level summary of contents and cohort design.
- The variable metadata (or 'source variables') can be considered as a codebook or data dictionary of a cohort or data access provider (DAP) (e.g. ALSPAC or CHUT).
- Similarly, the common data model (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook of a network of cohorts or DAPs working together (e.g. LifeCycle or ConcePTION_WP7)
- The mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables as basis for integrated analysis.

This section explains how to submit the 'source variables' + 'mappings from source variables to target variables' into the Data Catalogue. Expected users of this 'how to' are data managers within the cohorts. This document assumes you have received login details for upload of your cohort.

#### Define variable metadata
We use the [*Dictionary template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/blob/master/docs/resources/Dictionary.xlsx) to define variable metadata. The [*Dictionary template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/blob/master/docs/resources/Dictionary.xlsx) consists of multiple sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the Data Catalogue (Figure 1). The columns in the sheet correspond to columns in the table concerned. This document describes how to fill out each of the sheets and their columns. A column with an asterisk (\*) after its name is mandatory, i.e., it should contain values for the system to accept a data upload. Note that there is no sheet for *AllSourceVariables*. This table is a generic listing of all variables entered for the cohort; it shows *SourceVariables_ and *RepeatedVariables* in one table.

It is good practice trying out adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds. To upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the section [Upload metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#upload-metadata) to the Data Catalogue.

#### Define harmonisations
We use the [*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/blob/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) to describe the harmonisations. The [*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/blob/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) consists of one sheet. It is used to define the mappings from source variables to target variables.

#### *TableMappings* sheet
Harmonisation procedures at the table level are defined in the *TableMappings* sheet.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fromTable \* | Source table name. | Tables must be predefined in the *SourceTables* sheet. |
| toNetwork \* | Network name that contains the variable to map to. | e.g. LifeCycle or LongITools or ATHLETE or ConcePTION_WP7 |
| toTable \* | Target table name. | Map to a table that is defined in a common data model. |

### Upload metadata
When you filled out the template(s) you can start uploading the metadata. When you log in to MOLGENIS Data Catalogue you will see a listing of databases that are accessible to you. Click on your cohort's database to access it. Move to 'Up/Download' via the menu. Use 'browse' to select a template and 'upload' to start uploading your data. You can now view your data under 'Tables'.

Please report any bugs or difficulties to [molgenis-support@umcg.nl](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl).
#### Find harmonisations
When your data is uploaded to the Data Catalogue you can find your own harmonised variables in variable details.

Use the search bar to find your variable(s) of interest.

Click on "variable details"

Click on "Harmonization"

![](img/cat_variable-mapping.png)

#### Request access (catalogue)
If you do not have an account to upload data to the Data Catalogue yet, please e-mail [molgenis-support](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl) to apply for an account.

## Armadillo
Upload harmonised data into a local Armadillo/Opal instance in order to make it available for DataSHIELD to run analyses. Note that MOLGENIS Data Catalogue does not communicate or have access to any data stored in Armadillo/Opal.

### Request access (Armadillo)
The Armadillo works with a central authentication service. This means to work with the Armadillo you need to have an account on the central authentication service. To acquire an account please follow instructions on [this video](https://youtu.be/Gj0uANX8nIw).

### Initial upload
There are two phases to uploading data to the Armadillo. The initial upload transforms your source data to the right format for analysis. Besides this you can perform some data manipulation on the initially uploaded data. 

The initial upload can be done with the [dsUpload](https://lifecycle-project.github.io/ds-upload).
### Create subsets
To manipulate the data after the initial upload you can use the [MolgenisArmadillo](https://molgenis.github.io/molgenis-r-armadillo) client.
You can use the [MolgenisArmadillo](https://molgenis.github.io/molgenis-r-armadillo) to create data subsets. Check the [documentation](https://molgenis.github.io/molgenis-r-armadillo/articles/creating_data_subsets.html) to create subsets.

### Assign permissions
After the correct authentication and authorisation steps have been set up, researchers will be able to analyse the cohortâ€™s data via DataSHIELD. We use the authentication service to give people permission to analyse the data. There are several steps you need to perform to give people access:

- create a role
- register a user
- give a user a role

We assume you have already created the necessary data sets for the researcher in question. After that you can navigate to the authentication service of the Armadillo. This [manual](https://molgenis.github.io/molgenis-js-auth) describes how to assign permissions to researchers.

### Quality control
There are two levels of quality control, central and local. You can perform local quality control yourself. This is done on the dataset you harmonised for the project. Usually the local quality control scripts are developed and distributed in the harmonisation manual. 

For central quality control we use the [dsUpload](https://lifecycle-project.github.io/ds-upload/articles/qualityControl.html) package. We are now developing quality control measures for the different variables. Continues, repeated etc. This is not finished yet. We will let you know when this is useable.

### Deploy an instance
To get the Armadillo installed at your institute you need to contact your IT-department and send the [installation manual](https://galaxy.ansible.com/molgenis/armadillo).

The system administrator needs to have specific information to set up the Armadillo. Each Armadillo is bound to a central authentication server. There needs to be an entry in this central authentication server for the Armadillo. You can email [*molgenis-support@umcg.nl*](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl) to get the specific information that applies to your Armadillo instance.
