# Data manager

The [MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/) provides a
framework for detailed descriptions of the following:
metadata of different types of resources, such as cohort studies and biobanks;
definitions of the variables collected in these resources;
and mappings of these variables to common data models.
Its purpose is to provide a gateway for finding and accessing health research data
and to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts ([Fortier et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27272186/))
and multi-data source studies ([Gini et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243569/)).

The metadata of resources consists of high-level descriptive information, such as contact details,
contents, design, and access and usage conditions.
The definitions of the source variables of a resource
(e.g. a cohort study like [ALSPAC](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/ssr-catalogue/all/collections/ALSPAC))
can be considered its codebook or data dictionary.
Similarly, the common data models (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook for a network of organisations
with access to multiple data resources
(e.g. [LifeCycle](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/ssr-catalogue/LifeCycle/variables)).
Combining these two, the variable mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables,
which can be used as a basis for integrated analysis. In some projects, data may be made available via [DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org/).
In these cases each resource stores the data locally in a [MOLGENIS Armadillo](../armadillo/) DataSHIELD server.

This page describes the process of filling out metadata and variable information for a resource
and uploading this to the catalogue. Users of this guide are expected to be data managers within the organisations
with access to the resources to be included in the catalogue, who can submit metadata, source variables
(also called collected variables) and variable mappings. In addition, it can be used by central data managers
of networks with a common data model such as LifeCycle or LongITools, who can submit metadata and target variables
(also called the harmonised variables or common data model).
This document assumes you have received login details for upload of your variables and metadata.
If this is not the case, see the section on [requesting access](#request-access).

## Staging areas

The metadata of the resource are first uploaded into what are called the 'staging areas' of the catalogue.
Later on the metadata are transferred to the main catalogue
Use of a staging area allows for review before the information becomes available through the live catalogue.
If the data in your staging area is ready for transfer you can let us know by emailing us through [MOLGENIS support](mailto:support@molgenis.org).

When you log in, you will be able to see at least the following databases:

- **Aggregates**: A database where aggregate data are stored.
- **Your own database**: The staging area of the resource you are working on.
Use this to fill out rich metadata and to upload the variable templates once you have filled them out.
- **catalogue**: The main catalogue, where your data will eventually be transferred to.
This is also where you can search for target variables to map to.
- **CatalogueOntologies**: This database contains the ontologies (or look-up lists)
that you need for filling out some columns in the templates, e.g. format or unit.
These are centrally managed by us. If you need something added to these look-up lists, [let us know](mailto:support@molgenis.org).
- **Test databases** (here: testCatalogue, testCohort, testDatasource, testNetwork and testStaging):
You can see filled out example metadata in these databases.

## Fill out rich metadata

Open your staging area and open the table **Resources**. The **id** and **name** columns are already filled in.
Click on the pencil sign next to this entry to start editing your metadata by filling out
the form. For additional detail, or if you are planning on entering source variables,
make sure to fill in the tables **Collection events** and **Subpopulations** as well.
These contain valuable metadata items for describing your resource in more detail.
Also, you can later refer to these from columns in the dictionary templates to indicate
which variables were collected during which collection event and for which subpopulation.

## Define data dictionaries and common data models

The next sections explain how to define variable metadata, which can be used to create data dictionaries (also known as codebooks),
in the case of source variables, and common data models, in the case of target variables, in the MOLGENIS catalogue.
For the creation of data dictionaries, you can also watch this
[instruction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Ef_Uiw1gE&amp;ab_channel=MOLGENIS).
Note that this video uses an older version of the dictionary model (2.x).
However, the basic principles remain the same, although column names have changed between this version and the current version.
There is no specific instruction video for the creation of common data models, but network data managers might still find
the video a useful introduction to definining variable metadata in the MOLGENIS catalogue.

## Define variable metadata

We use the [Dictionary template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Dictionary.xlsx)
to define metadata on variables, creating data dictionaries (with source variables) or common data models (with target variables).
The [Dictionary template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Dictionary.xlsx)
consists of multiple sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the catalogue (Figure 2 and 3).
The columns in each sheet correspond to columns in the table of the same name.
Here, we describe how to fill out each of the sheets and their columns.
Columns marked with an asterisk (\*) are mandatory,
i.e., they need to be filled in for the system to accept the data as valid. Depending on your needs, you can download a
[filled-in example for source variables](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Dictionary_testCohort.xlsx)
and a [filled-in example for target variables](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Dictionary_testNetwork.xlsx),
as a reference for filling out the template.

It is good practice to try adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds.
See the section [Upload variable metadata](cat_resource-data-manager.md#upload-variable-metadata) for details on how to upload.

## Define harmonisations

We use the [*Mappings template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) to
describe the harmonisations,
i.e. mappings from a resource's source variables to the target variables of a common data model (CDM).
The [*Mappings template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx)
consists of two sheets: Dataset mappings and Variable mappings.
Dataset mappings defines mappings from a dataset containing source variables to a dataset of the CDM.
Variable mappings is used to define the mappings from source variables to target
variables, which corresponds to the Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process of a resource
to a common data model (CDM). You can download this
[*filled out example*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings_testCohort.xlsx)
as a reference for filling out the template.

[example template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings_testCohort.xlsx)
for an example on how to fill this out (last line)._

## Upload variable metadata

When you have filled out the template(s) you can start uploading variable metadata. To do this, log in to the
[MOLGENIS catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/apps/central/#/), where
you will see a list of staging areas and other databases that are accessible to you.
You can also reach the staging areas via the catalogue menu: click **More** and select **Upload data**.
Click on the staging area for your resource and
go to **Up/Download** in the menu. Use **Browse** to select the file containing the filled-in template and
click **Import** to start uploading. A progress report is displayed and if your upload completes without
errors, your variable metadata is available for viewing under **Tables**.

If your variable metadata is correctly uploaded and ready for transfer from the staging area
to the main catalogue, contact us at [MOLGENIS support](mailto:support@molgenis.org).
Once the data is transferred, you can find your own harmonised variables and variable details in the
[harmonised variable explorer](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/ssr-catalogue/all/variables) ([manual](cat_researcher)).

If you encounter any difficulties during this process, feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@molgenis.org).
