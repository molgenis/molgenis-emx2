# Data manager of a cohort or data source

## Catalogue

### Data harmonisation

Each organization with access to data (which may be a cohort, or to a data source composed by one or more data banks)
harmonises their data according to the consortiumâ€™s protocols into a common data model (CDM) format which has been
centrally agreed on. In some projects, data may be made available via DataSHIELD. In these cases each resource stores
the data locally in [MOLGENIS Armadillo](/#/armadillo/) DataSHIELD server.

### Staging areas for uploads

The metadata of the cohort or of the data source is uploaded to what are called "staging areas" of the Data Catalogue.
You will need credentials to log in and upload metadata.  
LifeCycle, ATHLETE and LongITools use [*data-catalogue-staging*](https://data-catalogue-staging.molgeniscloud.org).  
ConcePTION uses [*emx2-conception*](https://emx2-conception.test.molgenis.org).

When you log in, you will be able to at least see the following databases:

- Catalogue: The common data models of your consortia, which you need to use in the mappings or ETL.
- CatalogueOntologies: This database contains the look-up list that you need for filling out some columns in the
  templates, e.g. format or unit. If you need to add anything to these look-up lists, contact us
  at [molgenis-support](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl).
- The database of your own cohort or data source, that you can use to upload the templates once you have filled them
  out.

### Define metedata of cohorts or data sources

[MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#/variable-explorer/) provides a
framework to describe in detail metadata of cohorts and of data sources, definitions of the variables collected in
cohorts and in the data banks composing the data sources (aka 'source variables'), and mappings to common data models (
aka 'target variables'). Its purpose is to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts together, and multi-data
source studies [Gini et al, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243569/).

- The metadata of cohorts include descriptive information such as contact details, name of the cohort, and high level
  summary of contents and cohort design. The metadata of data sources, of the correspending data banks and of the
  institutions that provide access to them, include descriptive information such as contact details, reason for
  existence of the data banks, what prompt the records in the data bank, and lag time for updating and accessing data.
- The metadata of the source variables (also known as 'data dictionary') can be considered as a codebook or data
  dictionary of a cohort (e.g. ALSPAC) and of the tables composing the data banks of data sources (e.g. the Danish
  Healthcare Registries).
- Similarly, the common data models (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook of a network of institutions
  with access to cohorts or data sources (e.g. LifeCycle or ConcePTION)
- The mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables as basis for integrated analysis.

This section explains how to submit the 'source variables' + 'mappings from source variables to target variables' into
the Data Catalogue. Expected users of this 'how to' are data managers within the institutions with access to cohorts or
data sources. This document assumes you have received login details for upload of your metadata. You can also watch
this [*instruction video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Ef_Uiw1gE&amp;ab_channel=MOLGENIS).

#### Define source variable metadata / data dictionary

We use the [*Dictionary template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Dictionary.xlsx)
to define variable metadata. The [*Dictionary
template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Dictionary.xlsx) consists of multiple
sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the Data Catalogue (Figure 1). The columns in the sheet correspond to
columns in the table concerned. This document describes how to fill out each of the sheets and their columns. A column
with an asterisk (\*) after its name is mandatory, i.e., it should contain values for the system to accept a data
upload.

<sup>Note that there is no sheet for *AllSourceVariables*. This table is a generic listing of all variables entered for
the cohort; it shows *SourceVariables* and *RepeatedVariables* in one table.</sup>

It is good practice trying out adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds. To
upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the section [Upload metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#upload-metadata)
to the Data Catalogue.

<sup>*Figure 2. Tables in a cohort's or DAP's database in the Data Catalogue.*</sup>

#### *SourceTables* sheet

The tables in a cohort or in the data banks of a data source are defined in the *SourceTables* sheet. Columns with an
asterisk (\*) after their name are mandatory.

| *Column name* | *Description* |
| --- | --- |
| name \* | Unique table name. |
| label | Table label. |
| description | Table description. |

#### *SourceVariableValues* sheet

The coding of categorical variables is defined in the *SourceVariableValues* sheet. This sheet is optional, but it is
highly recommended to fill out the codes and values for your categorical variables, so that your data becomes more
insightful for those that are interested.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variable.table \* | Table that contains the variable. | Tables must be predefined in the _SourceTables_ sheet. |

<sup>*Figure 5. Example of SourceVariableValues filled out in Excel.*</sup>

#### *RepeatedSourceVariables* sheet

The *RepeatedSourceVariables* sheet is optional, and is most often used by cohorts whose variables are observed
repeatedly. Variables that are repeats of a variable defined in the sheet *SourceVariables* are defined in the *
RepeatedSourceVariables* sheet. Defining your repeated variables using this sheet will limit the amount of information
that has to be repeated when filling out repeated variables. This sheet is optional.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| table \* | Table name. | e.g. core |
| name \* | Variable name. | e.g. height\_1 |
| isRepeatOf.table \* | Table that contains the variable that is repeated. | Tables must be predefined in the _
SourceTables_ sheet; e.g. core |
| isRepeatOf.name \* | Name of the variable that is repeated. | Variables must be predefined in the _
SourceVariables_ sheet; e.g. height\_0 |
| collectionEvent | Refer to a collection event. | The collectionEvent needs to be predefined in the _
CollectionEvents_ sheet; e.g. y1 or y2 |

<sup>*Figure 6. Example of RepeatedSourceVariables filled out in Excel.*</sup>

#### *CollectionEvents* sheet

The *CollectionEvents* sheet is optional, and is most often used by cohorts. The timing of data collection in events is
defined in the *CollectionEvents* sheet. It can be used to describe time periods within which the data for variables are
collected. The events are defined here and referred to from the sheets *SourceVariables* and/or *
RepeatedSourceVariables*.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name \* | Name of the collection event. | e.g. y9 |
| description | Event description. | e.g. Between 9 and 10 years. |
| ageGroups | The age groups that were sampled within this collection event. | Find list to choose from in CatalogueOntologies  (AgeGroups) |
| subcohorts | (sub)populations that are targeted with this collection event | e.g. women or children |

<sup>*Figure 7. Example of CollectionEvents filled out in Excel.*</sup>

#### *Subcohorts* sheet

The sheet *Subcohorts* is optional, and is most often used by cohorts. Here you may describe populations that can be
linked to collection events.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name \* | Name of the subpopulation. | e.g. mothers or children |
| description | Subpopulation description | |

#### Define harmonisations

We use the [*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) to
describe the harmonisations. The [*
Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) consists of two
sheets (TableMappings and VariableMappings). It is used to define the mappings from source variables to target
variables, or the Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process from a data source to a common data model (CDM).

#### *TableMappings* sheet

Harmonisation procedures at the table level are defined in the *TableMappings* sheet, irrespective of whether the table
is in a cohort or in a data bank.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fromTable \* | Source table name. | Tables must be predefined in the *SourceTables* sheet. |
| toNetwork \* | Name of the target network or common data model. | e.g. LifeCycle, LongITools or ATHLETE or ConcePTION_WP7 |
| toTable \* | Target table name. | Map to a table that is defined in a common data model. |
| description | Description of the harmonisation. | |
| syntax | Syntax used for this harmonisation. | |

<sup>*Table 7. Description of the columns that can be filled out for VariableMappings. \* = mandatory</sup>

Harmonisation procedures at the variable level are defined in the *VariableMappings* sheet.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fromTable \* | Source table name. | Tables must be predefined in the *SourceTables* sheet. |
| fromVariable | Source variable name(s). | Variables must be predefined in the _
SourceVariables_ sheet. When multiple variables are mapped together use a comma-separated list, e.g. v\_1,v\_2,v\_3. |
| toNetwork \* | Name of the target network or common data model.  | e.g. LifeCycle, LONGITOOLS or ATHLETE |
| toTable \* | Target table name. | Map to a table that is defined in a common data model. |
| toVariable \* | Target variable name. | Map to a variable that is defined in a common data model. |
| match | Whether the harmonisation is partial, complete or NA (non-existent). | Find list to choose from in CatalogueOntologies (StatusDetails) |
| description | Description of the harmonisation. | |
| syntax | Syntax used for this harmonisation. | |
