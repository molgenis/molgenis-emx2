# Data manager of a cohort or data source

## Data Catalogue

[MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#) provides a
framework to describe in detail: metadata of cohorts and of data sources; definitions of the variables collected in
cohorts and in the data banks composing the data sources (aka 'source variables'); and mappings to common data models 
(aka 'target variables'). Its purpose is to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts together 
[Fortier et al, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27272186/), and multi-data
source studies [Gini et al, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243569/).

- The metadata of cohorts include descriptive information such as contact details, name of the cohort, and high-level
  summary of contents and cohort design. The metadata of data sources, of the corresponding data banks and of the
  institutions that provide access to them, include descriptive information such as contact details, reason for
  existence of the data banks, the prompt for the records in the data bank, and lag time for updating and accessing data.
- The metadata of the source variables (also known as 'data dictionary') can be considered as a codebook or data
  dictionary of a cohort (e.g. ALSPAC) and of the tables which make up a data source's data bank(s) (e.g. the Danish
  Healthcare Registries).
- Similarly, the common data models (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook for a network of institutions
  with access to cohorts or data sources (e.g. LifeCycle or ConcePTION)
- The mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables as a basis for integrated analysis.

### Data harmonisation

Each organisation with access to data (which may be a cohort, or a data source composed of one or more data banks)
harmonises their data according to the consortiumâ€™s protocols into a common data model (CDM) format which has been
centrally agreed upon. In some projects, data may be made available via DataSHIELD. In these cases each resource stores
the data locally in a [MOLGENIS Armadillo](/#/armadillo/) DataSHIELD server.

### Staging areas for uploads

The metadata of the cohort or of the data source are first uploaded into what are called "staging areas" of the Data 
Catalogue. Later on the metadata are transferred to production; use of a staging area allows for review before the 
metadata are entered in the live catalogue. 

You will need credentials to log in and upload metadata. 

LifeCycle, ATHLETE and LongITools use [*data-catalogue-staging*](https://data-catalogue-staging.molgeniscloud.org).  
ConcePTION uses [*conception-acc*](https://conception-acc.molgeniscloud.org).

When you log in, you will be able to see at least the following databases:

- <b> DataCatalogue</b>: The catalogue data, in which you can search for target variables to map to.
- <b>CatalogueOntologies</b>: This database contains the look-up list that you need for filling out some columns in the
  templates, e.g. format or unit. If you need to add anything to these look-up lists, contact us
  at [molgenis-support](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl).
- <b>SharedStaging</b>: A communal staging area in which e.g. Contacts and Institutions are added and edited.
- <b>Your own database</b>: use this to upload the templates once you have filled them out.

### Fill out cohort rich metadata

Open your staging area, navigate to 'Tables' and open the table 'Cohorts'. Your cohort pid and name are already 
filled out. Click on the pencil sign next to this entry to start editing your cohort rich metadata by filling out 
the form.

### Define metadata of cohorts or data sources

This section explains how to submit the 'source variables' + 'mappings from source variables to target variables' into
the Data Catalogue. Expected users of this 'how to' are data managers within the institutions with access to cohorts or
data sources. This document assumes you have received login details for upload of your metadata. You can also watch
this [*instruction video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Ef_Uiw1gE&amp;ab_channel=MOLGENIS).

#### Define source variable metadata / source data dictionary

We use the [*Dictionary template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceDictionary.xlsx)
to define variable metadata. The [*SourceDictionary
template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceDictionary.xlsx) consists of multiple
sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the Data Catalogue (Figure 1). The columns in the sheet correspond to
columns in the table concerned. This document describes how to fill out each of the sheets and their columns. A column
with an asterisk (\*) after its name is mandatory, i.e., it should contain values for the system to accept a data
upload. You can download this 
[*filled out example*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceDictionary_testCohort.xlsx) 
as a reference for filling out the template.

<sup>Note that there is no sheet for *AllSourceVariables*. This table is a generic listing of all variables entered for
the cohort; it shows *SourceVariables* and *RepeatedSourceVariables* in one table. </sup>

It is good practice to try adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds. To
upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the section [Upload metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#upload-metadata).

#### *RepeatedSourceVariables* sheet

The *RepeatedSourceVariables* sheet is optional, and is most often used by cohorts whose variables are observed
repeatedly. Variables that are repeats of a variable defined in the sheet *SourceVariables* are defined in the *
RepeatedSourceVariables* sheet. Defining your repeated variables using this sheet will limit the amount of information
that has to be repeated when filling out repeated variables. This sheet is optional.

<sup>Table 5. Description of the columns that can be filled out for RepeatedSourceVariables. * = mandatory</sup>

#### *CollectionEvents* sheet

The *CollectionEvents* sheet is optional, and is most often used by cohorts. The timing of data collection in events is
defined in the *CollectionEvents* sheet. It can be used to describe time periods within which the data for variables are
collected. The events are defined here and referred to from the sheets *SourceVariables* and/or *
RepeatedSourceVariables*. Collection events can also be filled out when filling out the 
[cohort rich metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#fill-out-cohort-rich-metadata).

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resource \* | Your cohort pid | |
| name \* | Name of the collection event | e.g. y9 |

<sup>Table 6. Description of the columns that can be filled out for SourceCollectionEvents. * = mandatory</sup>

#### *Subcohorts* sheet

The sheet *Subcohorts* is optional, and is most often used by cohorts. Here you may describe populations that can be
linked to collection events. Subcohorts can also be filled out when filling out the
[cohort rich metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#fill-out-cohort-rich-metadata).

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |

#### Define harmonisations

We use the [*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceMappings.xlsx) to
describe the harmonisations. The 
[*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceMappings.xlsx) consists of two
sheets (TableMappings and VariableMappings). It is used to define the mappings from source variables to target
variables, or the Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process from a data source to a common data model (CDM).
You can download this
[*filled out example*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceMappings_testCohort.xlsx)
as a reference for filling out the template.

#### *TableMappings* sheet

Harmonisation procedures at the table level are defined in the *TableMappings* sheet, irrespective of whether the table
is in a cohort or in a data bank.

| *Column name* | *Description* | *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fromDataDictionary.resource \* | Source cohort pid |  |
| fromDataDictionary.version \* | Source data dictionary version | |

### Upload metadata

When you have filled out the template(s) you can start uploading the metadata. When you log in to MOLGENIS Data 
Catalogue you will see a listing of databases that are accessible to you. Click on your cohort's database to access it. 
Go to 'Up/Download' in the menu. Use 'browse' to select a template and 'upload' to start uploading your metadata. After 
uploading, you can view your metadata under 'Tables'.

Please report any bugs or difficulties to [molgenis-support](mailto:molgenis-support@umcg.nl).

#### Find harmonisations

When your data is uploaded to the Data Catalogue you can find your own harmonised variables in variable details in the 
[Variable Explorer] (https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#/variable-explorer/) 
once they have been transferred there. 
Use the search bar to find your variable(s) of interest.
