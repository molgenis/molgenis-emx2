# Data manager of a data resource

## MOLGENIS catalogue

[MOLGENIS catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#) provides a
framework to describe in detail: metadata of different data resources, such as cohorts and data sources; definitions of 
the variables collected in these resources; and mappings to common data models. Its purpose is to provide a gateway to 
find and access health research data and to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts 
[Fortier et al, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27272186/) and multi-data source studies 
[Gini et al, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243569/).

- The metadata of data resources include descriptive information such as contact details, name of the resource, a high-level
  summary of contents and design, and access and use conditions. 
- The metadata of the source variables can be considered the codebook or data
  dictionary of a cohort or other data resource (e.g. ALSPAC) and of the tables which make up a data source's data bank(s) (e.g. the Danish
  Healthcare Registries).
- Similarly, the common data models (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook for a network of organisations
  with access to cohorts or data sources (e.g. LifeCycle or ConcePTION)
- The mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables as a basis for integrated analysis.

### Data harmonisation

Each organisation with access to data (which may be a cohort, or a data source composed of one or more data banks)
harmonises their data according to the consortiumâ€™s protocols into a common data model (CDM) format which has been
centrally agreed upon. In some projects, data may be made available via [DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org/). 
In these cases each resource stores the data locally in a [MOLGENIS Armadillo](/#/armadillo/) DataSHIELD server.

### Staging areas for uploads

The metadata of the cohort or of the data source are first uploaded into what are called "staging areas" of the MOLGENIS 
catalogue. Later on the metadata are transferred to production; use of a staging area allows for review before the 
metadata are entered in the live catalogue. 

You will need credentials to log in and upload metadata. Contact us at [molgenis support](mailto:support@molgenis.org)
to receive credentials.

Cohorts in projects such as ATHLETE, IPEC and LongITools use 
[*MOLGENIS catalogue*](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/apps/central/#/).  

When you log in, you will be able to see at least the following databases:

- <b>catalogue</b>: The catalogue data, in which metadata is visualized and you can search for target variables to map to.
- <b>CatalogueOntologies</b>: This database contains the look-up list that you need for filling out some columns in the
  templates, e.g. format or unit. If you need to add anything to these look-up lists, contact us
  at [molgenis-support](mailto:support@molgenis.org).
- <b>Your own database </b>: Use this to fill out rich metadata and to upload the templates once you have filled them out.
- <b>Test databases</b> (here: testCohort, testDatasource and testNetwork): You can see filled out example metadata in these databases.
- <b>Aggregates</b>: a database where aggregate data are stored.

### Fill out rich metadata

Open your staging area, navigate to 'Tables' and open the table 'Resources'. Your resource id and name are already 
filled out. Click on the pencil sign next to this entry to start editing your rich metadata by filling out 
the form. For cohort studies 'Subcohorts' and 'Collection events' should also be filled out through this route. 
You can later refer to them from columns in the dictionary templates to indicate which variables were collected 
during which collection event.

### Define codebooks or data dictionaries

This section explains how to submit 'source variables' + 'mappings from source variables to target variables' into
MOLGENIS catalogue. Expected users of this 'how to' are data managers within the organisations with access to cohorts or
data sources. This document assumes you have received login details for upload of your metadata. You can also watch
this [*instruction video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Ef_Uiw1gE&amp;ab_channel=MOLGENIS). Note that this video used 
dictionary model version 2.x, which was updated to 4.x. The basic principles remain the same, but column names vary between these versions.

#### Define source variable metadata / source data dictionary

We use the [*SourceDictionary template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceDictionary.xlsx)
to define variable metadata. The [*SourceDictionary
template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceDictionary.xlsx) consists of multiple
sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the catalogue (Figure 1). The columns in the sheet correspond to
columns in the table concerned. This document describes how to fill out each of the sheets and their columns. A column
with an asterisk (\*) after its name is mandatory, i.e., it should contain values for the system to accept a data
upload. You can download this 
[*filled out example*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/SourceDictionary_testCohort.xlsx) 
as a reference for filling out the template.

It is good practice to try adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds. To
upload the metadata to the catalogue see the section [Upload metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#upload-metadata).

<sup>*Figure 2. Tables in a cohort's database in the MOLGENIS catalogue. Note that not all tables are filled out 
via the templates, some are filled via an online form, see section 
[Fill out rich metadata](cat_cohort-data-manager.md#fill-out-rich-metadata).*</sup>

#### Define harmonisations

We use the [*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) to
describe the harmonisations. The 
[*Mappings* template*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings.xlsx) consists of two
sheets (Dataset mappings and Variable mappings). It is used to define the mappings from source variables to target
variables, or the Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process from a data source to a common data model (CDM).
You can download this
[*filled out example*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/Mappings_testCohort.xlsx)
as a reference for filling out the template.

#### *Dataset mappings* sheet

Harmonisation procedures at the table level are defined in the *Dataset mappings* sheet, irrespective of whether the table
is in a cohort or in a data bank.

### Upload metadata

When you have filled out the template(s) you can start uploading metadata. When you log in to 
[*MOLGENIS catalogue*](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/apps/central/#/) 
you will see a listing of databases that are accessible to you. Click on your resource's database to access it. 
Go to 'Up/Download' in the menu. Use 'browse' to select a template and 'upload' to start uploading your metadata. After 
uploading, you can view your metadata under 'Tables'.

Please report any bugs or difficulties to [*molgenis support*](mailto:support@molgenis.org).

#### Find harmonisations

When your data is uploaded to the Data Catalogue you can find your own harmonised variables in variable details in the 
[Harmonised variable explorer](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/apps/docs/#/catalogue/cat_researcher)
once they have been transferred there. 

#### Request access (catalogue)

If you do not have an account to upload data to the catalogue yet, please
email [*molgenis support*](mailto:support@molgenis.org) to apply for an account.
