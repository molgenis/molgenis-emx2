# MOLGENIS Catalogue Guide

Welcome to the MOLGENIS Catalogue Guide! This guide explains what a MOLGENIS Catalogue is and how you can best use it.
To help you get to the right information, we've distinguished three roles for users of the catalogue:
a researcher, looking to find relevant data for their research,
a resource data manager, managing the metadata and variable mappings of their resource,
and a network data manager, managing the metadata and common data model of their network.
Use the table below to find the most relevant section for your role and goal.
