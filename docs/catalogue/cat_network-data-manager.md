# CDM / Network data manager

The Network data manager is responsible for uploading the common data model (CDM) to the Data Catalogue.

## Catalogue

### Define CDM metadata

[MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#/variable-explorer/) (sometimes
also called 'EMX2 catalogue') provides a framework to describe in detail cohort metadata, definitions of the data
variables collected (aka 'source variables') and mappings to common data models (aka 'target variables). Its purpose is
to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts.

- The cohort metadata provides descriptive information such as contact details, name of the cohort, and high level
  summary of contents and cohort design.
- The variable metadata (or 'source variables') can be considered as a codebook or data dictionary of a cohort (e.g.
  ALSPAC).
- Similarly, the common data model metadata (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook of a network of
  cohorts working together (e.g. LifeCycle)
- The mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables as basis for integrated analysis.

This section explains how to submit the 'target variables' (also called the harmonised model or common data model) into
the Data Catalogue. Expected users of this 'how to' are central data managers of networks such as LifeCycle or
LongITools. You will need login details to upload data to MOLGENIS Data Catalogue.

#### Define common data elements

We use the [*
NetworkDictionary* template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/NetworkDictionary.xlsx)
to describe the common data model elements. The [*
NetworkDictionary* template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/NetworkDictionary.xlsx)
consists of multiple sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the Data Catalogue. The columns in the sheet
correspond to columns in the table concerned. This document describes how to fill out each of the sheets and their
columns. A column with an asterisk (\*) after its name is mandatory, i.e., it should contain values for the system to
accept a data upload. Note that there is no sheet for *AllTargetVariables*. This table is a generic listing of all
variables entered for the cohort; it shows *TargetVariables* and *RepeatedTargetVariables* in one table.

It is good practice trying out adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds. To
upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the section To upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the
section [Upload metadata](cat_network-data-manager.md#upload-metadata) to the Data Catalogue.

#### *TargetVariableValues* sheet

The coding of categorical variables is defined in the *TargetVariableValues* sheet. This sheet is optional, but it is
highly recommended to fill out the codes and values for your categorical variables, so that your data becomes more
insightful for those that are interested.

will limit the amount of information that has to be repeated when filling out repeated variables. This sheet is
optional.
