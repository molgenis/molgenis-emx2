# CDM / Network data manager

The Network data manager is responsible for uploading the common data model (CDM) to the Data Catalogue.

## Catalogue

### Define CDM metadata

[MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/#/variable-explorer/) (sometimes
also called 'EMX2 catalogue') provides a framework to describe in detail: cohort metadata; definitions of the data
variables collected (aka 'source variables'); and mappings to common data models (aka 'target variables). Its purpose is
to facilitate pooled data analysis of multiple cohorts.

- The cohort metadata provides descriptive information such as contact details, name of the cohort, and high-level
  summary of contents and cohort design.
- The 'source variables' can be considered as a codebook or data dictionary for a cohort (e.g.
  ALSPAC).
- Similarly, the common data model metadata (or 'target variables') can be considered the codebook for a network of
  cohorts working together (e.g. LifeCycle)
- The mappings describe how source variables have been converted into target variables as basis for integrated analysis.

This section explains how to submit the 'target variables' (also called the harmonised model or common data model) into
the Data Catalogue. Expected users of this 'how to' are central data managers of networks such as LifeCycle or
LongITools. You will need login details to upload metadata to MOLGENIS Data Catalogue.

#### Define common data elements

We use the [*TargetDictionary* template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/TargetDictionary.xlsx)
to describe the common data model elements. The 
[*TargetDictionary* template](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/TargetDictionary.xlsx)
consists of multiple sheets. Each sheet corresponds to a table in the Data Catalogue. The columns in the sheet
correspond to columns in the table concerned. This document describes how to fill out each of the sheets and their
columns. A column with an asterisk (\*) after its name is mandatory, i.e., it should contain values for the system to
accept a data upload. You can download this
[*filled out example*](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2/raw/master/docs/resources/TargetDictionary_testCDM.xlsx)
as a reference for filling out the template. Note that there is no sheet for *All variables*. This table is a generic listing of all
variables entered for the cohort; it shows *Variables* and *Repeated variables* in one table.

It is good practice to try adding a few variables to the template first and see whether your upload succeeds. To
upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the section To upload the metadata to the Data Catalogue see the
section [Upload metadata](cat_network-data-manager.md#upload-metadata) to the Data Catalogue.

### Fill out network rich metadata

Open your staging area, navigate to 'Tables' and open the table 'Networks'. Your network id and name are already 
filled out. Click on the pencil sign next to this entry to start editing your network rich metadata by filling out 
the form. The network's common data model should also be filled out in the same manner under 'Models'.'Subcohorts' 
and 'Collection events' are filled out through the same route, by accessing the corresponding tables. Make sure to 
choose the right <b>model</b> id under resource when defining your 'Subcohorts' and 'Collection events', e.g. LongITools
should select LongITools_CDM.


### Define the common data model

#### *Repeated variables* sheet

The *Repeated variables* sheet is optional. Variables that are repeats of a variable defined in the sheet *Variables* 
are defined in the *Repeated variables* sheet. Defining your repeated variables using this sheet
will limit the amount of information that has to be repeated when filling out repeated variables. This sheet is
optional.

| --- | --- | --- |
| resource \* | Id of the <b>model</b> that contains this variable | e.g LifeCycle_CDM or ATHLETE_CDM |
