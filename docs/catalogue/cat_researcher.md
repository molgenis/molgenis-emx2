# Researcher

When you have defined a research question it is time to find the relevant data to answer it.
You can use the [MOLGENIS Data Catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/) to compose your dataset.
Upon entering the Data Catalogue, you can choose to either search all harmonised variables
(by clicking on 'All variables' in the menu), or search the harmonised variables within a project,
such as the EUChildNetwork. The Data Catalogue only describes the harmonized variables,
it does **not** contain the actual data values.

## Find harmonised variables

You can use the search bar and filters to subset the harmonised variables.
In the example below, we searched for harmonised variables concerning 'diabetes'.
Additionally, you may filter on topics or on cohorts that mapped to these variables.

*In the future you will be able to use a shopping cart to select all variables of interest and create an overview.*

## Find harmonisation details

The harmonisation view allows you to see which cohorts have (partially) harmonised your variables of interest and thus
have those variables available for analysis.

When you click on a variable of interest, you can go to a detailed harmonisation overview for this variable.
When you scroll down, you see more harmonisation details per cohort
