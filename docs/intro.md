# Introduction

APOLOGIES: documentation is still under development so you may find some dead links. However, we believe you'd probably
like to see what we have :-)

## Platform

MOLGENIS is the world's most customisable platform for (scientific) data and FAIR principles (findability, accessbility,
interoperability and reusability). Use MOLGENIS to precisely model your data as a schema of tables, columns and
relationships. Then [MOLGENIS](http://molgenis.org)
auto generates a complete database application with advanced data entry forms, powerful data up/download options and
flexible query tools to help you collect, analyse and share your data. If you want to program, you can use PostgreSQL,
GraphQL api, batch web services or linked data RDF/TTL interface to query/update the data, and use VueJS to create your
own 'apps'.

## Differences with previous version of MOLGENIS

Core differences with molgenis/molgenis include that it is simpler to setup and operate, it allows multiple data
schemas, it has more sophisticated data modelling features, and for developers it presents data using a self-documenting
graphql api. Obviously it doesn't have all features of molgenis/molgenis yet, so that is being maintained as well until
adequate migration paths exist.

## Application suite (todo)

We are currently moving all our applications into EMX2 to provide you with an integrated catalogue of ready-to-use
solutions.

* Multi-centre study data catalogue - cohorts, biobanks, common data models and more
* FAIR genomes - samples, data, experiments, studies
* Rare disease patient registries
* etc
