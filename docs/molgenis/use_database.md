# Creating/managing databases

MOLGENIS allows you to create multiple databases on one server.

When you go to the root of your server you will see a listing of the databases. If you don't have permission to see any of
the databases then a warning will be shown.

If you cannot find it please go to https://servername/apps/central (Replace servername with your MOLGENIS instance)

If you have admin permissions you can create new databases using the '+' sign.
