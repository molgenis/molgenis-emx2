# Creating/managing databases

MOLGENIS allows you to create multiple data schemas on one server. Each schema functionally behaves like a seperate database, however cross schema 
references are possible.

When you go to the root of your server you will see a listing of the schemas. If you don't have permission to see any of
the databases then a warning will be shown.

If you cannot find it please go to https://servername/apps/central (Replace servername with your MOLGENIS instance)

If you have admin permissions you can create a new schema using the '+' sign.
