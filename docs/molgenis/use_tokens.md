# Tokens
MOLGENIS allows the user to create temporary tokens that can be used in scripts and programs that interact with a MOLGENIS EMX2 server.
The token grants the same permissions to schemas on the server as the user has when using the MOLGENIS instance through the website.

Generating a token is done as follows:

1. Sign in to the MOLGENIS instance

2. Click on the username in the upper right corner next to `Sign out` to open the account management dialog

3. Underneath _Manage tokens_ fill out text field with the name associated with the token and click the `Create token` button
 
4. Copy the resulting token from the green dialog box
