# Admin settings

You can find the 'admin' menu when on the MOLGENIS start page, when you view the list of databases (click the MOLGENIS
logo to get there). Only when signed in as 'admin' user will this menu item be shown.

Settings currently supported:

* LANDING_PAGE - to change landing page from default /apps/central to something else

## User management

Currently you can use the admin menu to view the users currently registered in the system. In addition you can create a
new user and/or set a user password.
