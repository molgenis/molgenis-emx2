# Data capture forms

## Use forms for data entry

You can edit records by navigating to a database, then select 'tables' and choose a table. If you have edit permissions
you will get a little 'pencil' icon which you can use to edit.

## Feature flags

The forms are split into multiple chapter based on headings. Set the `isChaptersEnabled` to `false` in the schema settings to disable this behaviour.
