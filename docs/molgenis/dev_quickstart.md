# Quickstart / Pull request review

Below are the steps to checkout the code, optionally a specific branch, build, and then look at the current functionality.

## Clone the code

Clone the latest version of the sourcecode from github using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```
git clone git@github.com:molgenis/molgenis-emx2.git
```

Optionally, checkout the branch you would like to review:

```
cd molgenis-emx
git checkout <branch name here>
```

Then you can either build + run the whole molgenis.jar, or use docker-compose to instantiate the backend and only run one app, described below. Or you can run
it inside IntelliJ.

## Build whole system

Requires [Postgresql 15](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and java (we use
[adopt OpenJDK 17](https://adoptium.net/)):
Optionally also install python3 for [scripts](use_scripts_jobs.md) feature.

On Linux/Mac this could go as follows (Windows users, please tell us if this works for you too):

**Start postgres using a native postgres installation**

See [Installation guide](run)

**Start postgres using docker-compose**
You can start postgres using `docker-compose`. The data will be mounted in a directory called `psql_data` where you start the docker-compose (default: repo
root-directory)

* Start postgres
  ```console
  cd molgenis-emx2
  docker-compose up -d postgres
  ```

* Dropping the molgenis scheme can be done by deleting the mounted directory on your repo root-directory.
  ```console
  cd molgenis-emx2
  rm -rf psql_data
  ```

**Start developing using gradle**

* Change into molgenis-emx2 directory and then compile and run via command
   ```
   cd molgenis-emx2
   ./gradlew run
   ```
* View the result on http://localhost:8080

Alternatively you can run inside [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Then instead of last ./gradlew step:

* Open IntelliJ and open molgenis-emx2 directory
* IntelliJ will recognise this is a gradle project and will build
* navigate to `backend/molgenis-emx2-run/src/main/java/org/molgenis/emx2'
* Right click on `RunMolgenisEmx2Full` and select 'run'

## Build one 'app'

Requires only [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [yarn 1.x](https://yarnpkg.com/)

* Start molgenis using docker-compose
  ```console
  cd molgenis-emx2
  docker-compose up
  ```
  You can verify that it's running by looking at http://localhost:8080
* Build the app workspace as a whole
  ```console
  cd apps
  yarn install
  ```
* Serve only the app you want to look at
  ```console
  cd <yourapp>
  yarn serve
  ```
  Typically the app is then served at http://localhost:9090 (look at the console to see actual port number)

## Tips

last updated 24 nov 2022

### IntelliJ plugins

* We use IntelliJ 2021.3.1 with
    * vue plugin
    * google-java-format plugin
    * prettier plugin, set run for files to include '.vue' and 'on save'
    * auto save and auto format using 'save actions' plugin

### Pre-commit hook

We use `gradle checkFormat spotlessCheck` to verify code follows standard format. You can use pre-commit build hook in .git/hooks/pre-commit to ensure we don't
push stuff that breaks the build. We have included two gradle task for this if you like.

To only run the checks (which you could fix by running `gradle format spotlessApply`), you can add:

```
./gradlew installPreCommitGitFormatCheckHook
```

To automatically apply the formatting and update your commit, you can add:

```
./gradlew installPreCommitGitFormatApplyHook
```

### Running tests in intellij

To enable gradle to run tests you must set the test runner to gradle.

Go to IntelliJ Preferences -> Build tools -> Gradle and then set Run tests using 'IntelliJ' (counter intuitive, don't choose gradle).

See https://linked2ev.github.io/devsub/2019/09/30/Intellij-junit4-gradle-issue/

To skip slow tests that are marked in junit @Tag('slow') switch from 'All in package' to 'tags' and set to '!slow' via the 'edit configuration' of your test runner in 'build configuration'

When you get error "java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException: Unable to make field private final java.util.Map java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableMap.m accessible: module java.base does not "opens java.util" to unnamed module @5cee5251"
that is because you need JVM parameter '--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED'

### Reset gradle cache/deamon

Sometimes it help to reset gradle cache and stop the gradle daemon

```
./gradlew --stop rm -rf $HOME/.gradle/
```

### Delete all schemas (destroys all your data!)

If you want to delete all the MOLGENIS generated schemas, roles and users in the postgresql and return to clean state, run
```gradle cleandb```

### Build+test drop/creates schemas in my database

Build test ('gradle test') will create database schemas, users, roles and passwords. If you don't like that than please consider to use a different database
instance for 'test'. You can use environment variables MOLGENIS_POSTGRES_** for this. See [Installation guide](run).

### VS code

Some of us also develop using VS code:

* It automatically will discover the gradle tasks
* To enable autoformatting of java using spottless,
  install [spottles plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richardwillis.vscode-spotless-gradle)
