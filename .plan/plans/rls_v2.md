# RLS v2 — Role + Group + Owner

## Status

Design locked. Worktree not yet cut. This plan lives on the current branch
`mswertz/poc/rls_using_one_role_and_policies` as the source of truth; when we
cut the new worktree from master, copy this file across as the starting point.

## Background

- Current branch (`rls_using_one_role_and_policies`) achieved a feature-rich RLS
  model but at high policy count (5+ per role × table) and architectural
  complexity (per-scope policies, sentinel `USING(false)` markers, multi-role
  union resolution).
- PR #6058 (`feat: row level permissions`) offered a simpler binary-RLS model
  with ~4 shared policies per RLS-enabled table and a single `mg_roles[]` row
  column. Too narrow for our requirements (no per-row owner, no per-verb
  scope variance, no view modes, no per-role variance on shared tables).
- This plan synthesizes the lessons: 6058's `mg_*` row-tag convention and
  one-role-per-user-per-schema constraint, plus our scope lattice and
  privacy-mode enforcement.

## Model (locked)

- **Role**: per-schema named permissionset. **Exactly one per user per schema**.
  Declares per-table per-verb scope ∈ `{NONE, OWN, GROUP, ALL}` plus
  `changeOwner` / `changeGroup` boolean flags. Stored as PG role
  `MG_ROLE_<schema>/<name>`. Permission scopes encoded in emitted policy DDL
  (no central metadata table).
- **Group**: per-schema named user-list. **Many memberships per user**. Pure
  membership only — no permissions, no description (just a name; log table can
  come later if needed). Stored as a row in `MOLGENIS.groups_metadata` with
  `users REF_ARRAY` to `MOLGENIS.users_metadata`.
- **`mg_owner`**: row-level column, `REF → MOLGENIS.users_metadata`. Required
  when any role on this table has `OWN` scope. Default value is the row's
  `mg_insertedBy` (emx2's existing createdBy field) — set via column DEFAULT
  or via the existing emx2 row-lifecycle trigger.
- **`mg_groups`**: row-level column, `REF_ARRAY → MOLGENIS.groups_metadata`.
  Required when any role on this table has `GROUP` scope. emx2's standard
  ref_array FK trigger already enforces that all referenced names exist;
  caller-side validation (caller can only reference groups they belong to,
  unless `changeGroup`) is enforced via column-level INSERT/UPDATE GRANTs
  (see below).
- **System roles** (Owner / Manager / Editor / Viewer): unchanged from master.
  Hold `BYPASSRLS` so they ignore custom-role policies entirely. The system
  role layer gates table-level access; the custom role layer gates row-level
  access, independently.
- **Defaults**: a role that does not list a table → scope `NONE` on that table
  → invisible. Empty `mg_groups[]` on a row → only OWN-scope role-holders or
  ALL-scope role-holders see it (system roles see it via BYPASSRLS regardless).

## Architecture

### Policy emission

For each `(custom_role, RLS_table)` pair we emit up to 4 policies — one per
verb (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) — only if the role's scope on that verb
is non-`NONE`. Scope is encoded into the policy `USING` (and `WITH CHECK` for
write verbs):

| Scope | USING / WITH CHECK |
|---|---|
| `ALL` | `true` |
| `GROUP` | `mg_groups && current_user_groups(current_schema)` |
| `OWN` | `mg_owner = current_user` |
| `NONE` | policy not emitted; verb not granted |

Policy naming: `MG_P_<role>_<table>_<verb>`. Match current branch convention.

**Scaling**: 4 × #custom-roles × #RLS-tables. With 5 roles × 10 tables × 1k
schemas = 200k policies. PG handles this; auditing remains tractable via the
naming convention. Constant policy count was a stretch goal we have explicitly
relaxed in favour of richer per-verb scope expressivity (see decision log
below).

### Group membership lookup

Group membership lives in `MOLGENIS.groups_metadata`:

| Column | Type |
|---|---|
| `schema` | TEXT |
| `name` | TEXT |
| `users` | REF_ARRAY → `MOLGENIS.users_metadata` |

PK = (`schema`, `name`). When the MOLGENIS schema is later exposed via the
emx2 standard API, group CRUD comes for free; until then we drive it via
GraphQL surfaces in Phase 6.

A `STABLE` SQL function exposes the current user's groups for the current
schema (one function in MOLGENIS, called from any schema's policies):

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION MOLGENIS.current_user_groups(schema_name TEXT) RETURNS TEXT[]
LANGUAGE SQL STABLE AS $$
  SELECT COALESCE(array_agg(name), ARRAY[]::TEXT[])
  FROM MOLGENIS.groups_metadata gm
  WHERE gm.schema = schema_name
    AND current_user = ANY (gm.users);
$$;
```

`STABLE` allows planner caching within a query. One catalog-style lookup per
query, not per row.

### `changeOwner` / `changeGroup` enforcement — column-level GRANTs

We do **not** use triggers. Postgres column-level UPDATE/INSERT grants give
us the enforcement directly:

- Default emit per role: `GRANT INSERT (col1, col2, …)` and
  `GRANT UPDATE (col1, col2, …)` over the role's permitted columns
  **excluding** `mg_owner` and `mg_groups`.
- If role flag `changeOwner` is true, additionally
  `GRANT INSERT (mg_owner)` and `GRANT UPDATE (mg_owner)`.
- If role flag `changeGroup` is true, additionally
  `GRANT INSERT (mg_groups)` and `GRANT UPDATE (mg_groups)`.

If a role lacks the grant, the SQL UPDATE/INSERT fails at the SQL layer with
a column-permission error. No trigger, no flag lookup at runtime.

`mg_owner` is set automatically on INSERT via column DEFAULT
(`DEFAULT current_user`) or via the existing emx2 row-lifecycle trigger that
already populates `mg_insertedBy`. Roles without `changeOwner` cannot
override the default because they lack INSERT on the column. Roles with
`changeOwner` can override at insert time (e.g. an admin-style assignment).

The flag values themselves (`changeOwner`, `changeGroup`) are not stored
separately — they are derivable from the column-level grants. The
`getPermissions(role)` API recovers them by inspecting
`information_schema.column_privileges`.

### View modes (EXISTS / COUNT / RANGE / AGGREGATE)

Java-side enforcement in `SqlQuery`, unchanged from current branch — port
verbatim. Policies do not participate. Privacy floor for `RANGE`:
`CEIL(COUNT(*)::numeric / 10) * 10`. View modes are computed against the
already-filtered row set produced by the row-level policies.

**Encoding** (decided): a single `SelectScope` enum per (role, table) with
values `NONE | EXISTS | COUNT | RANGE | AGGREGATE | OWN | GROUP | ALL` —
same shape as the current branch, conflating row-scope and view-mode in one
ordered ladder. This serves us today and the test surface already exists.

**Storage** (decided): the JSON document attached to the PG role via
`COMMENT ON ROLE` is the canonical PermissionSet — full per-table per-verb
scope record, plus the changeOwner/changeGroup booleans (which are
double-recorded as column grants for SQL-layer enforcement). Java reads the
COMMENT for view-mode lookups; policies and grants are derived projections.
No metadata table.

### Custom role exclusivity (one per user per schema)

Enforced at grant time in Java (not in PG). Before `GRANT MG_ROLE_<schema>/<x>
TO MG_USER_<u>`, check `pg_auth_members` for any other `MG_ROLE_<schema>/*`
already granted to `<u>` and reject. System roles are excluded from this
check.

### System role coexistence

Owner, Manager, Editor, Viewer at session level have `BYPASSRLS` set on the
PG role (master behaviour, untouched). Result: when a user is acting through a
system role, all custom-role policies are skipped. When the same user acts
through a custom role only, policies apply.

If a user has both a system role and a custom role granted in a schema, PG
session attribution is by `SET ROLE` (the active role determines BYPASSRLS).
Default: `SET ROLE` to the most-permissive system role available for ergonomic
parity with master. Override available via session config if needed.

## Phases

Acceptance criteria for each phase are captured in the exit-criteria line at
the end of that phase. The decision log below covers cross-cutting choices.
No separate spec files.

### Phase 0 — Plan freeze, scout

- Confirm `MOLGENIS.users_metadata` schema and primary key (likely
  `name TEXT PK`). Validate that a `REF_ARRAY` to it works for our access
  patterns.
- Verify there is no existing `MOLGENIS.role_metadata` table to extend (we
  expect none; if one exists we revisit (d) vs other storage choices).
- Capture exact JOOQ DSL utilities available in master for policy emission
  and DSL-safe role naming.
- Cut worktree: `git worktree add /Users/m.a.swertz/git/molgenis-emx2/poc/rls_v2 -b mswertz/poc/rls_v2 master`.
- Symlink `.claude` from master.
- Copy this plan into the new worktree.

Exit criteria: worktree exists, plan present, scout report appended to plan.

#### Phase 0 scout findings

1. **`MOLGENIS.users_metadata`** — exists in master and current branch. PK
   `username TEXT`, plus `password VARCHAR`, `enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL`,
   inherited `SETTINGS JSON`. Defined in `MetadataUtils.java:28, 264-267`.
   Suitable for REF / REF_ARRAY targets. No divergence risk.
2. **No competing role/group metadata tables** — clean slate. Only existing
   MOLGENIS tables: `schema_metadata`, `table_metadata`, `column_metadata`,
   `users_metadata`, `settings_metadata`, deprecated `version_metadata`.
   System roles hardcoded in `SqlRoleManager.systemPermissions()`.
3. **Policy emission helpers** — port from
   `SqlPermissionExecutor.java`: `createPolicy`, `createSelectScopePolicy`,
   `dropAllPolicies`, `grantTablePrivilege`, `revokeTablePrivilege`,
   `enableRowLevelSecurity`. Current naming: `MG_P_<role>_<verb>_<scope>`.
   v2 renames to `MG_P_<role>_<table>_<verb>` and drops scope from the name
   (scope lives in USING).
4. **DSL-safe role naming** — `SqlRoleManager.fullRoleName(schema, name)`
   line 981 returns `MG_ROLE_<schema>/<name>`, validates UTF-8 length
   against PG's 63-byte limit. JOOQ `name()` wrapper is the canonical safe
   quoter; `stripRolePrefix` in `SqlPermissionExecutor.java:394` for the
   inverse.
5. **BYPASSRLS inheritance** — unproven in codebase. Only `MG_USER_admin`
   carries BYPASSRLS directly. No test demonstrates the flag propagating
   via `GRANT role TO role`. Decision: add a Phase 1 micro-spike test
   before relying on this for the future `MG_BASE_*` extension; not a
   blocker for v2 phases 1–6 (we don't depend on base-role BYPASSRLS in
   the locked design).
6. **ref_array FK trigger** — reusable. `SqlColumnRefArrayExecutor.java:25-44,
   88-120` provides `createRefArrayConstraints` (reference-exists +
   referred checks) and `removeRefArrayConstraints`. GIN index automatic
   on ref_array columns. `mg_groups REF_ARRAY → groups_metadata.name`
   needs no new code.
7. **`mg_insertedBy`** — set by emx2 row-lifecycle trigger, not column
   DEFAULT. `Constants.java:41`. `SqlPermissionExecutor.java:280-293`
   already copies `mg_insertedBy` into `mg_owner` on RLS enablement.
   Decision: `mg_owner` defaults via the same trigger path (preferred
   over `DEFAULT current_user` so the column tracks the audit column).
8. **No existing `MG_BASE_*` roles** — no BYPASSRLS-bearing reusable base
   roles. The future-extension (shared-policy via base role) is greenfield.

### Phase 0.5 — Post-merge baseline (2026-05-01)

After merging origin/master (13 new commits, no rls_v2-scope overlap), the
test floor was established with a SINGLE combined gradle invocation. Running
the suites as separate `./gradlew` invocations causes 9 spurious failures
(DB-state leak between JVM processes). Always use the combined form.

Canonical baseline command (after `./gradlew cleandb`):

```
./gradlew :backend:molgenis-emx2-sql:test \
          :backend:molgenis-emx2-graphql:test \
          :backend:molgenis-emx2-io:test \
          :backend:molgenis-emx2-webapi:test \
          :backend:molgenis-emx2-nonparallel-tests:test \
          --no-parallel \
          -x :apps:collectDist -x :apps:pnpm_build
```

Baseline floor (all green — Phase 1 must keep this):

| Suite | Pass | Fail | Skip |
|---|---|---|---|
| sql | 279 | 0 | 1 (`TestRowLevelSecurity` disabled — old RLS) |
| graphql | 53 | 0 | 0 |
| io | 67 | 0 | 0 |
| webapi | 146 | 0 | 3 (`testScriptExecution`, `testExecuteSubtaskInScriptTask`, `PerformanceTest`) |
| nonparallel-tests | 6 | 0 | 0 |

### Phase 1 — Foundation: groups table + function (slice A)

Phase 1 is scoped to the foundation pieces that are independently testable
right now, without needing a custom role to exist (custom roles arrive in
Phase 2). The column-lifecycle plumbing (originally tasks 3, 4, 8 in the
locked design) moves into Phase 2 because those columns only get added/
removed when a role with OWN/GROUP scope is granted — implementing them
without a caller produces dead code waiting for Phase 2.

1. **Add `MOLGENIS.groups_metadata`** table with columns
   `(schema TEXT, name TEXT, users REF_ARRAY → users_metadata)`, PK
   `(schema, name)`. FK to schema metadata so deletion cascades.
2. **Emit `MOLGENIS.current_user_groups(schema_name)`** STABLE function —
   single source, called from any user schema's policies.
3. **Verify the existing emx2 ref_array FK trigger** rejects `mg_groups`-style
   references to non-existent group names — write a unit test against
   `groups_metadata`-shaped columns. Reuse, do not re-implement.
4. **Verify GIN index** on the ref_array column (auto-created by emx2
   ref_array machinery) — assertion test, no new code.

Exit criteria: groups table + function present in MOLGENIS schema after
DB init; ref_array FK trigger rejects bad group references; GIN index
verified; full combined-suite test floor still green
(sql/graphql/io/webapi/nonparallel = 0 failures).

#### Phase 1 status (2026-05-01)

- Implementation in place: `migration33.sql`, `MetadataUtils` table +
  `createCurrentUserGroupsFunction`, `Migrations.java` bumped to v33,
  `GroupsMetadataTest` covering structure / FK cascade / function /
  GIN index.
- Targeted test: `GroupsMetadataTest` 4/4 pass (~17s).
- **Pending**: user-run phase-boundary combined-suite from §0.5 to
  confirm test floor still green.

Deferred from the original Phase 1 design (now Phase 2):

- `mg_owner` column lifecycle (was task 3) — drives off OWN-scope role grant
- `mg_groups` column lifecycle (was task 4) — drives off GROUP-scope role grant
- B-tree index on `mg_owner` (was task 6) — driven by the column add
- Column-level INSERT/UPDATE GRANTs for changeOwner/changeGroup (was task 8) —
  driven by role grant

### Phase 2 — Custom role definition + column lifecycle

1. **`SqlRoleManager.createRole(schema, name, description)`** creates PG role
   `MG_ROLE_<schema>/<name>`. Reject duplicates and reserved name patterns.
2. **`setPermissions(role, PermissionSet)`** writes the role's per-table
   per-verb scopes by emitting policies (Phase 3 detail). Replaces all prior
   policies for this role atomically.
3. **`grantRoleToUser(role, user)`** with one-role-per-user-per-schema
   exclusivity check (rejects if user already holds a different custom role
   in this schema).
4. **`revokeRoleFromUser`**, **`deleteRole`**, **`listRoles`** — port from
   current branch with naming aligned.
5. **`changeOwner` / `changeGroup`** — emit column-level INSERT/UPDATE
   GRANTs as described in the architecture section. The PG ROLE COMMENT
   JSON also records the boolean for round-tripping via `getPermissions`.
6. **Column lifecycle** (lifted in from old Phase 1):
   - Add `mg_owner` column (REF → `MOLGENIS.users_metadata`, defaulted via
     existing emx2 row-lifecycle trigger) when the first role with OWN scope
     on the table is granted; drop when the last is removed. Verify
     B-tree index comes for free with the REF column.
   - Add `mg_groups` column (REF_ARRAY → `MOLGENIS.groups_metadata`) when
     the first role with GROUP scope is granted; drop when the last is
     removed.

Exit criteria: roles can be created, listed, granted, revoked, deleted via
GraphQL; one-role-per-schema constraint enforced; lifecycle round-trip tests
green.

### Phase 3 — Per-verb scope policies

1. For each `(role, table, verb)` with non-`NONE` scope, emit policy
   `MG_P_<role>_<table>_<verb>` with the USING/WITH CHECK from the table
   above.
2. `setPermissions` diffs old vs new and emits `CREATE`/`DROP POLICY`
   surgically (port `applyDiff` from current branch but adapt to per-verb
   per-(role × table) shape).
3. **GRANT/REVOKE table-level privilege** for the verb in step with policy
   creation/deletion (PG requires both the GRANT and the matching policy for
   filtered access).
4. **`mg_owner` / `mg_groups[]` column lifecycle** — driven by aggregate of
   all roles' scopes for this table:
   - Any role has `OWN` on any verb → `mg_owner` column present.
   - Any role has `GROUP` on any verb → `mg_groups[]` column present.
   - When the last such role flag goes away, drop column.

Exit criteria: policies appear/disappear on grant/revoke; SQL-level
enforcement matches expectation for each (scope, verb) cell;
`SqlPermissionExecutor`-equivalent tests green.

### Phase 4 — View modes (Java side)

1. Port `SelectScope` enum (NONE / EXISTS / COUNT / RANGE / AGGREGATE / OWN /
   GROUP / ALL) and capability methods (`allowsCount`, `allowsMinMax`,
   `allowsAvgSum`, `allowsGroupBy`, `allowsExactCount`, `allowsRowAccess`,
   etc.) from current branch.
2. Port the privacy-floor implementation in `SqlQuery.getCountField()`
   (`CEIL(COUNT(*)::numeric / 10) * 10` as `Long`).
3. Port the `SqlQuery` enforcement helper introduced in Phase 6.C
   (`requireSelectCapability`).
4. View-mode scopes (EXISTS / COUNT / RANGE / AGGREGATE) extend the row-level
   model — they layer on top of `OWN` / `GROUP` / `ALL` row-filtering. The
   role declares e.g. `select=AGGREGATE+ALL` meaning aggregate-only access
   to all rows. Encoding TBD: bitset on the policy verb, or two-axis scope
   field.

Exit criteria: privacy modes work as in current branch; aggregate-only and
range-only queries are correctly enforced; view-mode tests pass.

### Phase 5 — `changeOwner` / `changeGroup` capabilities

Already enforced by column-level INSERT/UPDATE GRANTs emitted in Phase 3.
This phase is reduced to integration testing:

1. Round-trip test: setting `changeOwner=true` adds the column grants;
   setting `false` revokes them.
2. Validation: SQL error wrapping in `SqlPermissionExecutor` translates the
   PG `permission denied for column mg_owner` into the user-facing
   `"role X cannot change row owner"`.
3. WITH CHECK on UPDATE policy already prevents broader category violations
   (e.g. updating to a row that would no longer be visible to the role).

Exit criteria: change-capability flags enforced via column grants; SQL
errors translated; tests cover allow/deny per flag.

### Phase 6 — GraphQL surfaces

We adopt the **current branch's existing API design** (already in use in our
repo's master after merge of our prior work, or directly portable from this
branch's source):

1. **`GraphqlPermissionFieldFactory`** — port; extend with the new
   `selectScope` / `updateScope` ladder values used by v2.
2. **`change(roles, members)` mutation** — keep the signature; adapt the
   PermissionSet input type to carry per-table per-verb scopes plus
   `changeOwner` / `changeGroup` booleans.
3. **Group CRUD** added as new mutations: `createGroup`, `deleteGroup`,
   `addGroupMember`, `removeGroupMember`. Naming convention matches existing
   schema-management mutations (no `v2` prefix).
4. **Authorization scope ceiling** (port from current branch Phase 6.B):
   only schema MANAGER / OWNER can grant custom roles or modify groups in
   their schema; admin retains override.
5. **Permission inspection queries**: extend existing `_schema.roles` (if
   present) with `_schema.groups`; per-role permission listing reads from
   the role's COMMENT JSON.

Exit criteria: GraphQL surface complete; permission UI in `apps/schema`
drives the model; e2e tests green.

### Phase 7 — Tests, performance, hardening

1. **Continuous master compatibility**: existing master tests must keep
   passing throughout development — Owner / Manager / Editor / Viewer /
   None all behave identically to master at every phase boundary. Run the
   full suite at the end of each phase. No separate "system role
   integration" phase.
2. Port test classes from current branch where applicable. Drop ones that
   tested the OLD scope/policy structure that no longer applies.
3. Cross-schema FK semantics — verify FKs to RLS tables behave correctly
   when row is invisible to current user.
4. Inheritance semantics — `mg_owner` and `mg_groups` columns on inheriting
   tables: child inherits via PG inheritance.
5. **Benchmark** target: 1M-row table, 5 custom roles, 100 groups, 10k
   users. Query latency < 2× non-RLS baseline. GIN index on `mg_groups`
   verified non-degraded.
6. Audit: `pg_policies` query patterns to list all policies for a (schema,
   role) pair — verify naming convention supports this.

Exit criteria: benchmark target met; full test suite green;
nonparallel-tests covers wildcard / heavy-DDL cases.

### Phase 8 — Migration & docs

1. Document the model in `docs/` with worked examples.
2. Upgrade path from master: existing schemas continue to work unchanged
   until a custom role with non-`NONE` scope is created on a table; at that
   point the foundation columns/triggers/policies are added on demand. No
   rewrite of existing data required.
3. Operator runbook: how to add a role, add a group, debug a "user can't
   see row X" issue (`pg_policies`, function output, role/group lookup).

Exit criteria: docs published; runbook reviewed by data managers.

## Decision log

- **Branch base**: master (not PR #6058). 6058 architecture diverges too far;
  rebase risk + adversarial PR-back outweighs alignment value. We borrow
  conventions, not code.
- **Membership storage split**: roles via PG GRANT (exclusive,
  `pg_auth_members`), groups via `MOLGENIS.groups_metadata` ref_array. Roles
  and groups are conceptually different; mixing both in `pg_auth_members`
  blurs the line.
- **No central role-metadata table**: scope encoded in policy DDL (Option d).
  Trades constant-policy-count goal for richer per-verb / per-role scope
  expressivity.
- **`changeOwner` / `changeGroup` flag storage**: PG ROLE COMMENT JSON.
  Lightweight; revisitable.
- **No base role inheritance** (Viewer / NONE): role explicitly lists
  per-table scopes. Few roles per schema, so verbosity is acceptable.
- **System roles untouched**: Owner / Manager / Editor / Viewer hold
  BYPASSRLS as in master. Custom-role mechanism is purely additive.
- **View modes Java-side**: privacy modes (EXISTS / COUNT / RANGE / AGGREGATE)
  enforced in `SqlQuery`, not in policies. Same as current branch.
- **Subgroups dropped as a separate concept**: replaced by flat per-schema
  groups. A user in a hierarchical structure simply joins multiple groups.
- **Disabled vs deleted users**: users are disabled, never deleted; orphan
  ownership is therefore not a concern.

## Open items

- Phase 0 scout findings on `MOLGENIS.users_metadata` PK shape — confirms or
  forces small adjustment to ref/ref_array column definitions.
- Benchmark numbers (Phase 7) once workload data is available — current
  target is < 2× non-RLS baseline; revisit if measured.

## Out of scope

- Cross-schema custom roles (a role spans schemas). Roles are schema-local.
- User-defined privacy floors (currently hardcoded to 10 for RANGE).
- Audit logs for permission changes — can be added later as separate table.
- Migration tooling from PR #6058's data layout — out of scope.
